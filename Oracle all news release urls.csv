Oracle Helps National Grid Cut Carbon through Weatherization
Opower Home Energy Reports spur hundreds of Massachusetts homeowners to weatherize their houses in just four months
Austin, Texas—April 13, 2022
Last winter, National Grid launched a new program aimed at weatherizing homes faster than ever. Using Oracle Utilities Opower disaggregation technology, National Grid identified households most in need of weatherization upgrades and sent them personalized program offers within Opower Home Energy Reports. In just four months, National Grid achieved a 2.9X higher rate of home weatherization among customers who received those offers.
National Grid is working to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, and its current plan calls for doubling the rate of energy efficiency retrofits by 2030. “The road to decarbonization goes through weatherization,” said Chris Porter, Director of Customer Energy Management at National Grid. “These home upgrades deliver comfort, bill savings, and enable our customers to take full advantage of emerging clean heating technologies.”
  Freezing out carbon and costs
The Northeast is home to more old housing stock than any other region in the United States. In winter months, the heat leaked from these homes contributes to increased carbon emissions and spending on utility bills. While weatherization upgrades can deliver deep, lasting energy savings, the cost and complexity of these projects can hinder a household’s willingness to pursue them.
National Grid has shown its behavioral energy efficiency program is one powerful solution to that problem. It reaches 1.2 million Massachusetts customers with energy reports, alerts, and web tools. Last winter, select customers received personalized reports highlighting their heating use and National Grid’s weatherization program. The reports used behavioral science techniques like descriptive norms, benefits framing, and salience to influence customers to take action.  
Between December and April, customers who received those reports completed National Grid-sponsored weatherization projects at a rate 2.9X higher than customers who did not receive them. That means Opower helped National Grid weatherize over 300 additional Massachusetts homes in one heating season. Emails with personalized offers generated a 75% higher click rate than emails with static content offers, and customers who clicked were 10X more likely to complete a weatherization project.
“The success of this initiative shows the power of leveraging data analytics and the utility experience to connect people with energy products and services that deliver real and lasting benefits,” added Porter. “And this is just the beginning. Over the next three years, National Grid is pursuing some of the most ambitious building decarbonization goals in the country. Data-driven innovations like this will continue to be essential to our success.”
State-level decarbonization goals are causing utility energy efficiency policies to evolve. Some policies favor utility investment in structural programs like building electrification and home retrofits over behavioral energy efficiency programs. However, a team of former utility commissioners at The Analysis Group published a study in 2020 that found behavioral programs like National Grid’s deliver as much carbon reduction as structural programs, 5X faster, and at 1/4th the cost. The report also noted that behavioral and structural programs deliver the most carbon reductions when run together.
“Energy providers across the United States need to influence customer action like never before in order to deliver on their decarbonization commitments,” said Paul McDonald, senior director of Opower product strategy for Oracle Energy and Water. “National Grid’s behavioral program nearly tripled their pace of weatherization program adoption. That’s amazing evidence that behavioral and structural efficiency programs work best together.”

Oracle Launches Complete Employee Experience Platform for Evolving Workforce Needs
Comprehensive platform within Oracle Cloud HCM gives HR and business leaders tools to support employee success with new solutions for listening, communication, productivity, and engagement
Austin, Texas—April 13, 2022
Oracle today announced Oracle ME, a complete employee experience platform to help organizations increase employee engagement and ensure employee success. Part of Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM), Oracle ME enables HR and business leaders to streamline communications across the organization, increase productivity by guiding employees through complex tasks, and improve talent retention by developing a more supportive and trusted environment at work.
The events over the past two years have changed the game for the global workforce—people’s expectations for what they want and need from their employers have evolved. According to the most recent Oracle AI@Work study, 85 percent of the global workforce are not satisfied with their employer’s support for their careers, and 87 percent believe their organization should be doing more to listen to the needs of its workforce. This has put increasing pressure on organizations to prioritize the employee experience, but without truly understanding the needs of individual workers, it’s difficult for HR and business leaders to design workplace experiences that support their employees through their careers and help them thrive personally and professionally. Personal priorities are driving professional decisions and workers are looking for guidance on how to succeed in their careers while balancing personal demands.
“Employees want to feel heard, empowered, and part of a culture they believe in. To meet these expectations, organizations need to step up and design experiences that meet the unique needs of their talent—or risk losing them to competitors that do,” said Yvette Cameron, senior vice president of global product strategy, Oracle Cloud HCM. “Part of designing better experiences involves seeing employees as unique individuals with their own needs, goals, and ways of getting things done. Oracle ME is all about converging workers’ information, critical insights, workflows, and preferences with a technology-enabled solution to give each individual something they can call ‘my experience’. It’s the only complete employee experience platform focused on understanding the ‘me’ behind every worker, providing organizations new ways to listen to, communicate with, support, and develop their hybrid workforce.”
Oracle ME delivers a better way to work by providing contextual and guided experiences that strengthen workplace relationships and allow employees to provide continuous feedback with their managers. Oracle ME also enables managers to track and act on real-time employee sentiment, while helping HR teams deliver personalized employee communications and support their entire workforce with direct access to the tools they need, when they need them. Oracle ME includes the following Oracle Cloud HCM solutions:
Oracle Touchpoints is a new employee listening solution that helps managers strengthen relationships with their employees and better support workforce wellbeing and success. Natively developed within Oracle Cloud HCM, Oracle Touchpoints allows managers to regularly capture, track, and act on employee sentiment to build trust with their teams and promote an inclusive work environment. Managers get continuous employee insights through pulse surveys and receive recommended next actions to take, such as scheduling check-ins, providing feedback, or celebrating moments that matter. The employee engagement center within Oracle Touchpoints allows employees to take an active role in their success and satisfaction by providing a single place to define and organize topics for check-ins, review meeting history, provide ongoing feedback, and access suggested actions.
Oracle HCM Communicate is a new employee outreach solution that allows HR teams to design, send, monitor, and measure the impact of communications. Built directly into Oracle Cloud HCM, HCM Communicate is connected to an organization’s workforce data, making it easy for HR teams to create and target personalized communications to groups with highly specific characteristics. For example, HR teams can send a message to workers in a specific city or country who are within two years of employment and enrolled in a particular training course. With HCM Communicate, HR teams can also measure engagement with the content through open rate analysis and seamlessly send follow ups or set up ongoing campaigns to drive more effective and engaging communications.
Oracle Journeys is a workflow solution that simplifies complex tasks with step-by-step processes and personalized guidance that helps employees navigate personal, professional, administrative, and operational activities, including onboarding, returning to work safely, growing career opportunities, managing team compensation, or opening a new facility. New enhancements help employees make informed decisions by surfacing personally relevant instructions, training, and analytics along their guided digital journey. Oracle Journeys can be extended to include workflow actions and resources from other Oracle and third-party applications to deliver guidance for different business needs across the organization.
Oracle Connections is an interactive workforce directory and organization chart that fosters collaboration and increases opportunities for inclusion and internal mobility by making it easier for employees to search for and connect with others across the organization. Employees can import their LinkedIn profiles, record video introductions, highlight their unique skills and accomplishments, and share feedback on each other’s walls to better learn about one another and grow their professional network.
Oracle HR Help Desk is a service request management solution that makes it easy for all workers to get the answers they need and for HR to effortlessly track cases without the risk of sensitive data getting into the wrong hands. Employees can search for content, securely submit inquiries, and open help tickets through multiple channels including Oracle Digital Assistant, SMS, email, and social platforms.
Oracle Digital Assistant is an HR chatbot that provides a conversational interface for employees to get immediate answers to questions and easily complete transactions directly through voice or text. HR teams can deploy Oracle Digital Assistant quickly to support over 90 prebuilt transactions and can extend the solution to support new processes or requirements.
Oracle ME is an open platform that extends across the Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications Suite. It also connects to and automates processes with third-party systems and works across multiple channels such as email, SMS, web browser, collaboration tools, and video conferencing. HR teams and business leaders can easily manage changes within Oracle ME to adjust to the changing work environment without the need for IT support, making it easier to deliver employee experiences that reflect a company’s unique culture.
  Supporting Quotes:
“Oracle ME is the birth of a new category. Everyone has an answer to Employee Experience these days, but Oracle is taking the conversation a step further,” said Jason Averbook, industry analyst, co-founder and CEO of Leapgen. “What we’ve treated as a luxury when it comes to personalized support and workforce communication is now a necessity. Oracle is meeting modern employee expectations and then some - and they’re not calling it a nice-to-have. Proactive listening, contextual guidance, and personalized communication is exactly what the workforce needs and deserves, and Oracle ME delivers.”
“One of the keys to creating a positive experience for our employees and managers is helping them take control of their information and their teams. With Oracle solutions like HR Help Desk, Digital Assistant, and Experience Design Studio we’ve been able to help managers complete common tasks like employee transfers in a fraction of the time it took before. Now, they get more time back to focus on adding value to the company,” said Gareth Abreu, Principal Technology Delivery Manager, HCM, at The Co-op. “We’re very excited about Oracle's ongoing efforts to improve employee experience with innovations like Journeys and the entire Oracle ME platform, which will continue to drive the success of our workforce and, therefore, our business.”
“It’s exciting to see platforms like Oracle ME enter the market and help businesses navigate some of the most important workforce challenges to-date. You can’t solve problems you don’t know about, so it’s important for organizations to ask their employees how they’re feeling. That’s the first step to building trust within the workforce,” Tim Sackett, president of HRUTech.com. “The next step—and arguably the most important—is to use what they say in strategic decisions so that they feel heard. Every employee is an individual, and to keep them engaged in your organization you need to treat them that way.”

Sometimes what makes you incredibly proud of your company is the incredible work done by customers using its solutions.
  At Oracle, we’ve committed ourselves to sustainability along many fronts, from our pledge to power all operations—including our data centers—entirely with renewable energy by 2025, to being Net Zero by 2050 in our entire value chain, to reusing or recycling well over 99 percent of the hardware we retire, to our enduring support for many non-profit organizations that work to protect our natural world.
  But what we can achieve ourselves is relatively small compared to what can be achieved by empowering customers who are equally dedicated to creating a more sustainable future.
  Every day, customers are using Oracle products to set and realize their own ambitious sustainability goals, all while driving business efficiencies that boost their bottom lines.
  That is exemplified by the winners of our 2021 Change Agents Sustainability Awards. It’s through this global program every year that we honor customers—companies large and small, educational institutions, non-profits and government agencies—who have demonstrated excellence in environmental leadership, cost reduction, and business efficiencies using Oracle Cloud technologies.
  Oracle has recognized five organizations with the 2021 Earthfirst Award for Operational Excellence in Sustainability for incorporating sustainability into their operational strategies. Recipients in that category distinguished themselves by leveraging Oracle Cloud applications to the benefit of their businesses and the environment.
  Japan's Ministry of the Environment (MoE) partnered with Oracle Japan/Jyukankya Research institute and five local major utilities (Hokkaido Gas, Tohoku Electric, Kansai Electric, Okinawa electriv) in Japan to use Oracle Opower Energy Efficiency Cloud Service to provide some 300,000 households personalized guidance for reducing their energy consumption and associated carbon dioxide emissions. The four-year effort, called the MoE Nudge Project, took advantage of Oracle Cloud AI and big data/analytics capabilities to help those households, on average, save 2 percent off their energy usage, preventing the emission of 47,000 tons of CO2.
  Oceanworks, an innovative startup based in Boston, created a global marketplace for recycled plastics. Working through the Oracle for Startups program, Oceanworks turned to Oracle Intelligent Track and Trace, a prebuilt SaaS application that traces the collection and processing of recycled plastics to ensure lot level authenticity. Customers who procure their plastic through the Oceanworks marketplace count on this level of transparency.
  Jaquar Group championed a Go Green philosophy as a tenet in the design of its products. As part of its global expansion, India’s largest manufacturer of bathroom and lighting products built warehouses across the country adhering to a zero-waste manufacturing approach that also incorporates recycled water and solar power. A custom warehouse management system, powered by Oracle Supply Chain management solutions, as well as a high-performance web portal built on Oracle Platform Services, enabled Jaquar Group to efficiently run those zero-waste facilities. Laresen & Toubro Infotech Limited, a key partner in this successful transformation, nominated Jaquar Group for the award.
  Woolworths South Africa puts sustainability at the center of its business practices. Looking to advance what the company calls its Good Business Journey, a commitment that spills into every product, the multi-national retailer deployed Oracle Retail Brand Compliance Management Cloud Service (ORBC) to capture all food sustainability-related product data and report on those metrics.
  Chipotle, a restaurant chain, turned to Oracle to modernize and digitally enable accounting and financial management functions to drive efficiencies. By adopting Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP, Oracle Cloud EPM, and Oracle Cloud SCM applications, Chipotle gained clearer views across financial systems, leading to improved demand forecasting and inventory control. With those benefits, Chipotle is growing the business without compromising on its mission of serving real food sourced from sustainable farms. PWC, a key partner in this successful transformation, nominated Chipotle for the award.
  Oracle also recognized customers with the 2021 Gaia Awards for Innovation in Sustainability for their efforts to spur new forms of environmental progress. These organizations showcased how to keep environmental stewardship in mind by making innovative business decisions using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and advanced technologies such as AI, big data and Internet of Things.
  Anteja is a consulting firm focused on developing transparent and sustainable value chains. The Slovenia-headquartered company helps combat climate change, social inequalities and environmental risks with technology that is used to reward agribusinesses and small farmers, especially those in developing countries, who engage in sustainable business practices. Anteja has solved these types of challenges on behalf of private agribusinesses and multilateral agencies like the World Bank and International Finance Corporation. When the company was ready for its cloud transformation, it sought a cloud infrastructure provider that shared its commitment to renewable energy and engagement in a circular economy. Anteja now hosts its supply chain visibility applications on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
  Circulor, a partner in the Oracle for Startups program, has built cutting-edge technology to help make global supply chains more sustainable, with a specific focus on those that provide the constituents of electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Based in London, the startup ensures those products are produced more ethically and sustainably so manufacturers can responsibly cut carbon emissions. Circulor built its innovative product on Oracle technology, taking advantage of cutting-edge technology like Oracle Hyperledger Fabric, and using Oracle Cloud Blockchain Platform as an integration layer.
  And finally, Tracifier, another Oracle for Startups partners, has built its platform to develop sustainability practices and reduce food waste around the world using a blockchain core powered by Oracle Hyperledger Fabric which enables the secure and private storage and sharing of business data. Tracifier, based in Hamburg, Germany, applies blockchain and big data intelligence to combine documents and supply chain information from vetted datasets. That product enables real-time insights to verify sustainability and ethics claims linked to a product, empowering agribusinesses globally to become more sustainable.
  All of us at Oracle are so encouraged by the results that the 2021 Change Agents Sustainability Award winners have exhibited. These organizations, along with so many others, are pioneering methods of applying cloud technologies to benefit our planet, not only because it’s good for the environment but also because it’s good for business. We are more committed than ever to supplying such innovators with the advanced tools and close partnership they need to continue blazing a trail to a more sustainable future.

City of Tampa Redesigns Staff Operations with Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications
Florida municipality reduces costs and boosts employees’ productivity by moving finance and HR applications to the cloud
Austin, Texas—April 11, 2022
The City of Tampa, one of Florida’s largest municipalities, has upgraded its systems and operations with the Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications Suite. With Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM), Tampa has been able to strengthen its IT security, reduce costs, and streamline employee tasks by improving its finance and HR processes. With the newly freed up time and resources, Tampa’s staff has been able to dedicate more time to directly serving citizens. 
Oracle Consulting led the implementation using its proven Oracle Soar methodology, migrating the city from its existing on-premises systems to Oracle Cloud Applications on time and on budget.
“When we saw that Oracle could deliver significantly more modern and secure systems, at a lower cost and in such a short timeframe using Oracle Soar, it was a no-brainer,” said Russell Haupert, CIO, CTO and Director of IT, City of Tampa. “From ideation to implementation, Oracle brought their A-team. Moving key business systems is no easy feat. I’ve been through many implementations in my career, and this particular one was one we could be proud of with the help of Oracle Consulting.”
With Oracle Cloud HCM and Oracle Cloud ERP, Tampa is standardizing processes, removing data silos across departments, and empowering employees with more self-service capabilities. Among other improvements, the city has already replaced its once onerous invoice process; reconfigured its approval processes, which were previously executed on two conflicting approval engines; and revamped the user experience for its employees. In addition, Tampa has also improved IT security with Oracle’s consistent, automatic patching and is benefitting from the delivery of hundreds of new features every 90 days.
“Local governments work tirelessly to ensure the needs of their residents are met, which can be challenging with limited resources,” said Steve Miranda, executive vice president of applications development, Oracle. “With Oracle Fusion Applications, the City of Tampa has an integrated suite of HR and finance solutions in the cloud that will help it drive innovation and increase organizational efficiency so that it can better serve its constituents.”

Undercover Snacks Hits the Business Sweet Spot with NetSuite
Rapidly growing manufacturer of chocolate snacks replaces QuickBooks with NetSuite to support its business
Austin, Texas—April 7, 2022
Undercover Snacks, the innovative chocolate snack manufacturer, is using Oracle NetSuite to support its rapid expansion throughout the U.S. and globally. With the help of NetSuite, Undercover Snacks has been able to integrate its critical business operations so that it can seamlessly connect customer, supplier, production and warehouse data. Since implementing NetSuite, Undercover Snacks has gained complete visibility and control over inventory, business operations, and financial planning.
Inspired to create an incredibly delicious chocolate snack that was gluten-free and allergy friendly for two of her three daughters diagnosed with Celiac disease, Diana Levy launched Undercover’s flagship line of Chocolate Quinoa Crisps in 2017. Initially making small batches in a rented commercial kitchen and personally delivering to Whole Foods stores in the northeast, as sales and demand quickly grew Diana soon realized she needed to increase production significantly.  After searching unsuccessfully for co-manufacturers, Diana – joined by her husband Michael - designed and opened a state-of-the-art SQF-certified manufacturing facility capable of producing more than 40,000 bags a day. This investment enabled Undercover Snacks to expand its sales rapidly, with distribution increasing from approximately 2,000 to over 10,000 stores globally in the last two years. Undercover Snacks’ ability to innovate quickly has enabled the company to expand into alternative channels wherever snacks are consumed, including United Airlines which now offers Undercover Snacks on flights across the globe. As the company expanded, it quickly became apparent that existing systems and manual processes were taking up valuable time without providing the level of functionality or visibility needed. To address these challenges and establish an integrated platform to help scale in the future, Undercover Snacks replaced QuickBooks with NetSuite.
“With a uniquely delicious taste and texture, combined with a healthier nutrition profile, Undercover Snacks is experiencing strong and accelerating demand from consumers seeking better-for-you snacks that taste even better than conventional choices,” said Diana Levy, CEO and co-owner of Undercover Snacks.
“But as demand has soared, so did the complexity of our business,” added Michael Levy, chairman and co-owner of Undercover Snacks. “We knew we were being held back by the systems we were using and we wanted a solution that could support our sales growth and operational expansion plans. With NetSuite, we’ve automated critical business functions and gained greater insight into every aspect of our business. This is allowing us to fine-tune our operations, improve efficiencies, and ensure we maintain the highest level of food safety and quality as we continue to build our business. NetSuite is a force-multiplier allowing us to punch above our weight, and is an essential part of our ambitious growth plan.”
With NetSuite, Undercover Snacks can manage its entire business—from manufacturing to sales, accounting and its invoicing process—on one unified platform. NetSuite has enabled Undercover Snacks to optimize order fulfillment and invoice processing by centralizing all order and sales data from major distributors, direct retailers, Amazon and its own ecommerce site. NetSuite has also helped Undercover Snacks improve demand planning by enabling automating the inventory management process, sorting products by inventory level and expiration dates, and creating automated alerts and notifications. Additionally, NetSuite facilitates the company’s programs to monitor and maintain the highest operational standards related to on-time deliveries, food quality and safety, and other important KPIs, while providing visibility into its customers, suppliers, and carriers through electronic data interchange (EDI) integrations. To build on its success with NetSuite, it also recently implemented the NetSuite Warehouse Management System to further streamline its business as it continues to expand its operations to support expansion.
“Undercover Snacks has achieved impressive growth in just a few short years,” said David Rodman, SVP of Customer Success, Oracle NetSuite. “By centralizing manufacturing processes and integrating operations on NetSuite, Undercover Snacks is reaping the rewards of its business insights and is well positioned for future growth. We look forward to seeing its continued success.”

Oracle and AICPA & CIMA Team Up to Tackle the Technology Skills Gap in Finance
New certification series helps equip the next generation of finance leaders with digital finance transformation skills and supports the profession’s blueprint for the future of finance
Austin, Texas and New York—April 7, 2022
Oracle and the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants (the Association) founded by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), today announced an introductory certification series to address the technology skills gap in finance and accounting. Created in collaboration with Oracle, AICPA & CIMA’s new “Agile Finance Transformation Certification Series” is designed to equip finance leaders with practical knowledge required to embrace the latest finance technology, processes, best practices, and skills to help them succeed in changing business environments and accelerate their careers.
As businesses navigated recent market disruptions, finance teams rapidly embraced cloud technology that would help drive critical business decisions. However, only 10 percent of finance leaders believe their teams have the full complement of technology skills needed to support their organization’s finance transformation ambitions. To meet demand, create career advancement opportunities, and help their organizations succeed, finance professionals are hungry to improve their digital transformation skills. Yet, only six percent of finance leaders say they have a robust finance training program in place.
“The digital age provides new opportunities for the accounting and finance profession. To keep pace with digital transformation and changing expectations from business, finance professionals must evolve quickly and acquire new skills,” noted Tom Hood, EVP, Business Engagement & Growth at the Association. “To meet this demand, the Association partnered with Oracle to collaborate and develop the Agile Finance Transformation Certification Series to train finance professionals with practical knowledge and prepare for—and accelerate—their digital finance transformation.”
The course materials walk through critical steps for finance leaders to begin the transformation journey from the perspective of a finance practitioner who has successfully completed a transformation project. The certification series features key elements including:
Practical steps to guide a finance transformation journey
Proven best practices and corresponding operational blueprints
New skills that support and accelerate career development
Real world experiences delivered by Oracle finance leaders based on their own finance transformation
“The next generation of finance leaders are in a unique position to be exponential catalysts for change across an organization by leaning decisively into technology to drive strategic business value,” said Juergen Lindner, senior vice president and CMO, Global Marketing SaaS, Oracle. “With almost 700,000 members, students, and engaged professionals around the globe, the Association has tremendous influence over the direction of the accounting profession, and ultimately plays a key role in upskilling the industry to redefine what best looks like in finance.”
The “Agile Finance Transformation Certification Series” is now available globally from the AICPA Store. Attendees can earn 21.5 Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credits for the three-part certification. The total cost of the program is US$1,485 for non-AICPA or CIMA members, and US$1,195 for members.

Merlin Entertainments is the world’s second-largest operator of family entertainment destinations, including LEGOLAND theme parks and SEA LIFE aquariums. To ensure guests have the best visit from the theme park to hotel room, the company is using Oracle MICROS Simphony Point-of-Sale (POS) and Oracle Hospitality OPERA Property Management technology. With Oracle’s digital solutions, Merlin guests can use their mobile devices to better plan their vacation in advance and save precious time. This includes taking advantage of mobile check-in at hotels and the ability to pre-order food at their favorite attractions.
“The attractions are always the stars, but today there is more demand for people’s attention, so we really need to stand out from the crowd,” said Lee Cowie, Chief Technology Officer at Merlin Entertainments. “We do that by constantly innovating, delivering new experiences, and creating new reasons for guests to come back. Oracle offers a strong, reliable, and well-thought-out suite of technologies that help us accomplish these goals.”
Merlin Entertainments operates 140 attractions, 23 hotels and six holiday villages in 24 countries, which in addition to LEGOLAND and SEA LIFE Aquariums, includes global attractions Madame Tussauds, Alton Towers, and Gardaland Resort.
  Personalizing the experience
Recent research from Oracle Food and Beverage and Merlin Entertainments shows that 52% of consumers are increasingly looking to plan ahead and personalize their trips. Merlin Entertainments is constantly seeking out innovative technologies to help deliver on these evolving guest expectations. Using OPERA at select hotels, guests can manage reservations from their mobile devices, check-in to their hotel rooms with the click of a few buttons or use the digital QR code generated by the system to get a room key at convenient kiosks.
Visitors can also use a mobile app connected to MICROS Simphony to order and pay for their meals in advance. Simphony’s built-in restaurant analytics ensure the kitchens at the hotels and parks are receiving the orders quickly and prioritizing them based on pick-up expectations, helping ensure meals are on time. For example, a LEGOLAND Windsor Resort visitor can pre-order food at their favorite destination and have it ready at a set time—eliminating time wasted standing in line and enabling more time to spend on their favorite rides.
“For Merlin Entertainments, the future is about how we make our guest experience even better, and we see state-of-the-art technology as a route to be able to deliver the very best day out. This allows us to be even more guest obsessed than we already are,” said Chris Ireland, Commercial and Hotel Director at LEGOLAND Windsor Resort. “Oracle’s innovative technology has allowed us to create a seamless guest journey from the moment they book on the site, to when they arrive on the day.”
The MICROS Simphony systems also enable Merlin Entertainments to break down the barrier between staff and guests. With mobile tablets, staff can do everything from upgrade a guest’s accommodations, to take drink and snack orders at the pool. With better intelligence on each customer’s profile and preferences at their fingertips, team members can make more helpful and relevant recommendations to ensure guests have a magical and memorable visit.
“Easy, contactless, and fast is what consumers now expect whether they are simply eating out, or planning a great theme park getaway,” said Simon de Montfort Walker, senior vice president and general manager at Oracle Food and Beverage. “Merlin Entertainments is at the cutting edge of this trend, extending new Oracle tech innovations across a guest’s experience—from the hotels to the park. Not only is this helping create a more seamless, memorable visit for the guest, but it also helps keep staff agile, responsive, and fueling new revenue streams.”

COFINA Banks on Oracle to Get Loans to Underserved Businesses Faster
African mesofinance provider taps Oracle Financial Services to enhance its digital services for small-to-medium sized businesses
Côte d'Ivoire, Africa and Austin, Texas—April 5, 2022
Compagnie Financiere Africaine (COFINA), an Africa-based financial group in Côte d’Ivoire and majority owned by Compagnie Transnationale D’Investissement (C.T.I.), has tapped Oracle Financial Services to enhance its banking systems. COFINA is focused on mesofinance, a relatively new concept that offers small loans starting from 1,000 Euros specifically for small-and mid-sized businesses (SMEs).
With the Oracle Banking portfolio, COFINA will bring next generation digital capabilities to the business it serves, including timely loans and a cohesive banking experience. The implementation will start with the migration of Cofina Côte D’Ivoire, one of COFINA’s nine mesofinance subsidiaries.
“We selected Oracle Financial Services to help transform our operations and services,” said Adiline Haykal, Group Director strategic projects, COFINA. “Building a successful digital bank requires a platform that can run efficiently while evolving with changes in the market and alongside organizational needs. As a first step, Oracle Banking solutions will provide Cofina Côte D’Ivoire the foundation needed to provide and adapt to consumers’ desired digital client experiences.” Listen to more on Cofina’s story here.
COFINA will use Oracle Banking technologies including  Oracle FLEXCUBE Universal Banking as its digital core, Oracle Banking Digital Experience, and Oracle Banking Payment Hub, among others.
  A new kind of financial institution for an underserved market
While digital banking has opened the door for individuals in both urban and rural areas of Africa to access affordable, reliable banking, financing offers for SMEs remain nearly non-existent. Only 6.4% of African SMEs have access to bank financing even though they are the main providers of wealth and job creation in African economies. With SMEs too big for microfinancing and too small for commercial banks, COFINA dedicated itself to serving this segment of the market with mesofinance. Today, the organization has financed more than 121,000 projects worth nearly 1,544 Million USD (≈ 1,300 million euros).
“COFINA is a leader in providing inclusive banking services in West Africa,” said Venky Srinivasan, group vice president, APJ & MEA, Oracle Financial Services. “Oracle’s solutions have powered a wide variety of business models across 140 countries, from digital startups to the large incumbents. Our applications help banks differentiate with pace, agility, and responsiveness to clients. Oracle technologies will empower COFINA to deliver a more efficient, centralized, and seamless customer experience that will position them for future growth.”
Oracle Banking financial services applications enable banks to offer a complete set of digital banking services to customers. The portfolio includes the digital core and applications for retail and corporate banking, real-time payments, and digital experience. Built on a microservices architecture with 3000-plus open banking APIs, Oracle Banking makes it easy for banks like COFINA to “plug in” additional Oracle and third-party services when they need them. It also provides a scalable, cloud-native environment for growth.

NTT DOCOMO Selects Oracle Cloud to Boost Development Capabilities for One of the World’s Largest Customer Information Management Systems
Japanese mobile operator taps Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to improve service quality and enable faster delivery through automation of operation management utilizing Oracle Container Engines for Kubernetes
Tokyo, Japan—April 4, 2022
NTT DOCOMO, INC. (DOCOMO), the largest mobile operator in Japan, has adopted Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to build its new development environment for ALADIN (ALl Around DoCoMo INformation Systems), one of the largest customer information management systems in the world. Using OCI, the system’s 300 developers can now build modern applications in a faster and more cost-efficient manner, while DOCOMO benefits from highly available and secure compute resources, as the company expands to broader telecommunications, internet and smart life services. In addition, DOCOMO has moved its on-premises Oracle Database for database training to Oracle Database Cloud Service on OCI.
ALADIN supports DOCOMO’s more than 83 million subscriber base, handling all customer-related operations, such as membership and transactional data, credit checks, contract data and assignment of telephone numbers. DOCOMO’s customer information is rapidly expanding alongside the mobile operator’s ‘d POINT CLUB’ reward points program, growing numbers of traditional cell phone subscribers, and new customer touchpoints, such as chatbots and smart devices. To meet this business expansion and enable faster delivery of better services, DOCOMO is modernizing the ALADIN development environment by moving it to the cloud. As part of this, DOCOMO built a new development environment on OCI to serve approximately 300 developers.
Tadaaki Yoshida, Information Systems Department, NTT DOCOMO, INC., said, “Our goal is to ensure that ALADIN, a mission critical system which serves as NTT DOCOMO’s customer hub, operates in a reliable manner and delivers an excellent customer experience. The new environment on OCI supports development, coding, and integration testing. Its roll out has quickly proven how we can optimize our costs and improve developer productivity and efficiency through containerization and automation. The Oracle Cloud Free Tier also has allowed us to build the new environment quickly and at a lower cost. We plan to move the entire development environment to the cloud as we prepare for the future migration of our commercial environment and are looking forward to the evolution of the services and technologies provided on OCI.”
Each developer now has a dedicated environment and the ability to flexibly change resources during peak and slow periods of development, eliminating the need to manually provision and shut down environments and providing the resources needed on demand. In addition to improving the productivity and efficiency of the developer team, DOCOMO also used Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) for containerization, and plans to leverage Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery and Deployment (CI/CD) tools to further automate operational management.
As part of the cloud migration, DOCOMO has also moved its on-premises Oracle Database environment to Oracle Database Cloud Service on OCI. This environment is used by database administrators from dedicated devices to verify and train database recovery procedures and conduct training, including the reproduction of failure conditions in an environment similar to the commercial environment. With the move to Oracle Database Cloud Service, DOCOMO can enjoy Oracle’s pay-as-you-go service and provide database administrators with the flexibility and scalability to meet seasonal needs. This has allowed DOCOMO to reduce costs by 95% by minimizing the manual workload required for managing and operating the environment.
Toshimitsu Misawa, member of the board, corporate executive officer and president of Oracle Corporation Japan, said, “Companies across the world are continuing to modernize their business processes to meet changing market and regulatory conditions and customer demands. Key to their success is the wealth of customer information that sits at their very heart, like in the case of DOCOMO’s ALADIN. Having a development environment that enables the information to be leveraged quickly, securely and reliably, and that supports faster software development is a source of competitive advantage. Oracle recently launched Oracle Cloud for Telcos which enables telcos to build new applications or modernize existing workloads on OCI. OCI is gaining a strong reputation for enabling business evolution by providing the extensive developer-friendly services needed to help organizations build, deploy and manage the next generation of applications, and leverage game-changing technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.”
DOCOMO aims to migrate the final operation testing environment, which is currently in an on-premises location, to the cloud, including Oracle Cloud, to further improve testing efficiency and application quality with flexible development and testing environments in the near future.

San Francisco Giants Score with Oracle Cloud
From concession stands to mobile devices, Oracle MICROS Simphony Cloud Point of Sale running on OCI speeds the ordering process so fans can spend more time enjoying the game
Oracle Park migrates critical disaster recovery system from AWS to OCI
Austin, Texas—April 1, 2022
The 2021 National League West Division Champion San Francisco Giants have added Oracle MICROS Simphony Cloud Point of Sale (POS) to their roster. The POS technology will make it easy for fans to order the park’s legendary food and beverage options at concession stands or from their mobile devices, giving them more time to enjoy the game. Behind the scenes, built-in restaurant business analytics and real-time data access will help Oracle Park improve inventory management to best serve guests while reducing food waste. The team has also moved its disaster recovery system for high-priority data, files and video to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) from AWS.
“From the delicious Crazy Crab Sandwich to our signature Gilroy Garlic Fries, Oracle Park is well-known for its world-class food and beverage program,” said Bill Schlough, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer, San Francisco Giants. “Oracle will help us make it faster and easier than ever for fans to enjoy our unique offerings while boosting our operational efficiency, better managing inventory, and reducing costs.”
Running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Simphony will provide the venue with the fast insights it needs to make informed decisions based on what is happening across inventory, pricing, and promotions. For example, if a popular promotion leads to an out-of-stock item, it will automatically be reflected on the park’s digital menu boards and mobile devices. Conversely, ballpark staff can also see if there is a surplus of a certain food and decide to run a new promotion to accelerate sales.
Additionally, to increase reliability and reduce costs, the Giants migrated their disaster recovery solution for important files and data, including their essential video environment, from AWS to OCI. The Giants’ 200 terabytes of video is a critical piece of the team’s winning formula and is used to measure player performance, to enhance training programs, and to evaluate players for scouting purposes. The Giants also use the video for in-park entertainment to ensure fans have the best possible experience at Oracle Park.
  Preparing for a curveball
With the Oracle restaurant POS at its foundation, Oracle Park will be able to quickly adapt to any concession related situation that comes its way. For example, ballpark staff can easily integrate and alter loyalty, promotion, and concession services through Simphony to adapt how it engages with fans before, during, and after the game. In future seasons, Oracle Park will implement self-service kiosks and grab-and-go checkout locations to add more convenience and choice for park-goers.
“Maintaining agility in the face of tumultuous market conditions and ever-evolving fan expectations is essential for ballpark operators,” said Simon de Montfort Walker, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Oracle Food and Beverage. “Oracle’s transaction platform, MICROS Simphony Cloud, helps venues serve fans faster, arms staff with intuitive tech, and automates business operations. With it, Oracle Park can help ensure its fan experience and business performance continues to be one of Major League Baseball’s best.”
The San Francisco Giants and Oracle have enjoyed a strong partnership for more than 15 years. Oracle is the naming rights partner for the Giants’ home, Oracle Park, which has played host to special events during Oracle’s flagship conference, now known as Oracle CloudWorld, over the years.

Impact Health Scales to Meet Demand for COVID-19 Testing with NetSuite
Leading provider of employee health screenings and contingent staffing implements NetSuite to support rapid growth for its onsite COVID-19 testing and vaccination programs
By Sam Levy, SVP of Sales, Oracle NetSuite—March 30, 2022
Impact Health, a leading provider of onsite COVID-19 testing and vaccination programs, is using Oracle NetSuite to automate critical financial processes and gain visibility across its business. With NetSuite, Impact Health has an integrated business platform to manage its network of thousands of nurses, including payroll and scheduling, and gains the insights needed to be confident in financial planning as it rapidly scales and adapts its operations to meet changing market demands.
Founded in 1987, Impact Health is now one of the nation’s largest providers of contingent healthcare staffing personnel. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, Impact Health quickly pivoted to meet the critical need for hyperlocal testing and vaccination programs for federal, state, city, municipal, and corporate clients across the United States. Since the beginning of 2020, Impact Health expanded its employee base from 300 to over 20,000 nurses and experienced explosive revenue growth. To support this expansion of personnel, clients, and operations, Impact Health needed to reimagine its core business systems. After careful evaluation, Impact Health selected NetSuite to automate financial processes and gain visibility across its entire business.  
“We quickly transitioned our entire business to help companies and government agencies with their employee COVID-19 testing and vaccination programs. As we expanded our operations to meet this demand, it became very clear that our systems could not efficiently support our growth,” said Jennifer Herdler, CFO of Impact Health. “We needed a unified system that could keep up with our business which was—and still is—changing dramatically. With NetSuite, we have automated and integrated core operations and this gives us full visibility into our financial health, inventory, project status, and employee network. Most importantly, NetSuite gives us the real-time information to make financial decisions and maintain profitability. NetSuite is an invaluable partner to us as we continue to scale.”
With NetSuite, Impact Health has automated and scaled its core business processes to support its shifting strategy and meet the massive demand for its services. Impact Health has optimized payroll and resource planning for its network of nurses and integrated its scheduling system with NetSuite to help automate the entire HR process for its growing employee base. Impact Health will leverage NetSuite’s inventory planning capabilities to make critical decisions regarding the purchasing and allocation of in-demand COVID-19 tests to support its clients across the nation.
By providing a unified suite to manage its entire business, NetSuite has also enabled Impact Health to gain full visibility into project data, which has helped it to adjust based on real-time information versus waiting until the end of the month. This helps Impact Health maintain profitability with margins that are impacted by a competitive labor market and shifting labor costs, as well as inflexible pricing for COVID-19 tests and vaccines. NetSuite will also support Impact Health’s future growth as it evaluates new revenue streams and the expansion into other healthcare offerings.
“It is impressive to see how Impact Health has been able to quickly adapt and scale to help their clients with what they needed most—COVID-19 testing,” said said David Rodman, SVP of Customer Success, Oracle NetSuite. “We’re excited to work with the Impact Health team as they continue to provide valuable healthcare services to businesses across the nation.”

Oracle Announces MySQL HeatWave ML—the Easiest, Fastest, and Least Expensive Way for Developers to Add Powerful Machine Learning Capabilities to their MySQL Applications
HeatWave ML fully automates model training, inference, and explanation
HeatWave ML is 25 times faster than Amazon Redshift ML at one percent of the cost
Austin, Texas—March 29, 2022
Oracle today announced that Oracle MySQL HeatWave now supports in-database machine learning (ML) in addition to the previously available transaction processing and analytics—the only MySQL cloud database service to do so. MySQL HeatWave ML fully automates the ML lifecycle and stores all trained models inside the MySQL database, eliminating the need to move data or the model to a machine learning tool or service. Eliminating ETL reduces application complexity, lowers cost, and improves security of both the data and the model. HeatWave ML is included with the MySQL HeatWave database cloud service in all 37 Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) regions.
Until now, adding machine learning capabilities to MySQL applications has been prohibitively difficult and time consuming for many developers. First, there is the process of extracting data out of the database and into another system to create and deploy ML models. This approach creates multiple silos for applying machine learning to application data and introduces latency as data moves around. It also leads to the proliferation of data out of the database, making it more vulnerable to security threats, and adds complexity for developers to program in multiple environments. Second, existing services expect developers to be experts in guiding the ML model training process; otherwise, the model is sub-optimal, which degrades the accuracy of predictions. Finally, most existing ML solutions don’t include functionality to provide explanations about why the models that developers build deliver specific predictions.
MySQL HeatWave ML solves these problems by natively integrating machine learning capabilities inside the MySQL database, eliminating the need to ETL the data to another service. HeatWave ML fully automates the training process and creates a model with the best algorithm, optimal features, and the optimal hyper-parameters for a given data set and a specified task. All models generated by HeatWave ML can provide model and prediction explanations.
No other cloud database vendor provides such advanced ML capabilities directly inside their database service. Oracle published ML benchmarks performed across a large number of publicly available machine learning classification and regression datasets such as Numerai, Nomao, and Bank Marketing, among others. On average, on the smallest cluster, HeatWave ML trains machine learning models 25 times faster at one percent of the cost of Redshift ML. Additionally, the performance advantage over Redshift ML increases when training is done on a larger HeatWave cluster. Training is a time-consuming process and since it can be done very efficiently and rapidly with MySQL HeatWave, customers can now retrain their models more often and keep up with changes to data. This keeps the models up-to-date and improves the accuracy of predictions.
“Just as we integrated analytics and transaction processing within a single database, we are now bringing machine learning inside MySQL HeatWave,” said Edward Screven, chief corporate architect, Oracle. “MySQL HeatWave is one of the fastest growing cloud services at Oracle. An increasing number of customers have migrated from Amazon and other cloud database services to MySQL HeatWave and have gained significant performance improvements and lower costs. Today, we are also announcing a number of other innovations which enrich HeatWave’s capabilities, improve availability, and lower the cost. Our new and fully transparent benchmark results again demonstrate that Snowflake, AWS, Microsoft, and Google are slower and more expensive than MSQL HeatWave by a large margin.”
  HeatWave ML offers the following capabilities compared to other cloud database services:
Fully Automated Model Training: All of the different stages in creating a model with HeatWave ML are fully automated and do not require any intervention from developers. This results in a tuned model which is more accurate, requires no manual work, and the training process is always completed. Other cloud database services such as Amazon Redshift provide integration with machine learning capabilities in external services, which require extensive manual inputs from developers during the ML training process.
Model and Inference Explanations: Model explainability helps developers understand the behavior of a machine learning model. For example, if a bank denies a client a loan, the bank needs to be able to determine which parameters of the model were taken into account, or if the model contains any bias. Prediction explainability is a set of techniques that help answer the question of why a machine learning model made a specific prediction. Prediction explanations are becoming increasingly important these days as companies must be able to explain the decisions made by their machine learning models. HeatWave ML integrates both model explanation and prediction explanations as a part of its model training process. As a result, all models created by HeatWave ML can offer model as well as inference explanations without the need of training data at inference explanation time. Oracle has augmented existing explanation techniques to improve performance, interpretability, and quality. Other cloud database services do not offer such rich explainability for all of their machine learning models.
Hyper-Parameter Tuning: HeatWave ML implements a new gradient search-based reduction algorithm for hyper-parameter tuning. This enables the hyper-parameter search to be executed in parallel without compromising the model accuracy. Hyper-parameter tuning is the most time-consuming stage of ML model training, and this unique capability provides HeatWave ML with a significant performance advantage over other cloud services for building machine learning models.
Algorithm Selection: HeatWave ML uses the notion of proxy models—which are simple models exhibiting the properties of a full complex model—to determine the best ML algorithm for training. Using a simple proxy model, algorithm selection is done very efficiently without loss of accuracy. No other database services for building machine learning models have this proxy modeling capability.
Intelligent Data Sampling: During model training, HeatWave ML samples a small percentage of the data in order to improve performance. This sampling is done in such a manner that all representative data points are captured in the sample data set. Other cloud services for building machine learning models take a less efficient approach—using random data sampling—which samples a small percentage of data without considering the data distribution characteristics.
Feature Selection: Feature selection helps determine the attributes of the training data which influence the machine learning model behavior for making predictions. The techniques in HeatWave ML for feature selection have been trained over a broad swath of data sets across multiple domains and applications. From these gathered statistics and meta information, HeatWave ML is able to efficiently identify the relevant features in a new data set. 
In addition to machine learning capabilities, Oracle released more innovations to the MySQL HeatWave service. Real-time elasticity enables customers to upsize and downsize their HeatWave cluster to any number of nodes, without any downtime or read-only time, and without the need to manually rebalance the cluster. Also included is data compression, which enables customers to process twice the amount of data per node and lowers costs by nearly 50 percent, while maintaining the same price performance ratio. Finally, a new pause-and-resume function enables customers to pause HeatWave to save costs. Upon resuming, both the data and the statistics needed for MySQL Autopilot are automatically reloaded into HeatWave.

"Mar 24, 2022",The Harvard COOP Modernizes 140-Year-Old Bookstore with NetSuite,https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/blog/the-harvard-coop-modernizes-with-netsuite-2022-03-24/,"Blog
The Harvard COOP Modernizes 140-Year-Old Bookstore with NetSuite
By Sam Levy, SVP of Sales, Oracle NetSuite—March 24, 2022
Long before a certain social network was founded in a Harvard dorm room, a group of Harvard students opened a business of their own. Believing that the local merchants in Harvard Square were overcharging students for necessities, they established The Harvard Cooperative Society—known as “the COOP”—to reduce the cost of living for Harvard students. Members paid a $1 fee and could shop for books, coal, and wood, all priced at just five percent over cost. The small profits were reinvested back into the COOP and soon, sales increased enough that the store was relocated to a larger space.
Nearly 140 years later, the historic COOP has grown to five store locations and an online platform and serves as the official campus bookstore for Harvard and MIT and their academic communities. The COOP’s main storefront in Harvard Square is in fact, the very same store that Evan Goldberg, EVP and founder of NetSuite, shopped for his books on his way to a degree in Applied Mathematics.
Today, the COOP’s reach has grown beyond Harvard and MIT as it proudly features the most diverse selection of popular and academic titles in the Cambridge/Boston area. It also operates as one of the largest collegiate retailers—offering the most extensive selection of officially licensed Harvard and MIT merchandise to customers around the country.
As a cooperative, the COOP is owned by its members, which include students, alumni, faculty, and staff of Harvard and MIT. With a $1 membership fee—the same as it’s been since it was founded in 1882—members receive a discount, special offers and events, and become a part of storied tradition.
  Age-Old Challenges
In May 2021, the COOP completed a major renovation of its Harvard Square store. Always striving to provide value for its members, COOP president Jerry Murphy embarked on an effort to modernize the campus bookstore experience. 
“Our top goal as an organization is to modernize our technology and operations for the betterment and benefit of our members,” said Murphy. “One specific area where we’re trying to improve is in differentiating our members from our customers. By integrating all customer data into one system, we could better tailor interactions between our members and our customers, which have very different needs.”
Taking the next step as a business meant moving beyond disconnected systems for financials, ecommerce, point-of-sale, and CRM. The COOP looked to increase business visibility and automate certain manual tasks to address these inefficiencies and establish a platform that could support it for the next 100 years. The COOP chose Oracle NetSuite to replace Sage Intacct and other existing systems. 
  Thriving with NetSuite
With NetSuite, the COOP will be able to integrate its financial, sales and ecommerce operations. This will empower the COOP with the insights needed to understand the financial health of its business and take a data-driven approach to exploring the possibilities of opening new locations, securing new suppliers, entering wholesale distribution, and conducting targeted marketing.
The breadth and depth of NetSuite and its ecosystem was a major selling point for the COOP as it continues to expand into product categories and new storefronts.
“NetSuite stood out to us because of its ability to scale and the customizations we can add to tailor NetSuite to our business. There are some functionalities we don’t need now but may need in a few years. With NetSuite, the platform grows as we grow,” said Murphy. “Those benefits, combined with the data integrations and NetSuite Advanced Customer Support, meant NetSuite can provide everything we need now and in the future.”
  Turning the Page to the Future
As a 140-year-old business that started in a dorm room, the COOP has outgrown its fair share of spaces, and the same was true with Sage and its other existing systems. With the increased visibility and efficiency that NetSuite will provide, the COOP expects to operate more nimbly, grow membership, and deliver more seamless experiences for its members and customers.
“Our expectation is that the insights we will gain from NetSuite will help us identify how we can provide better experiences for our community and increase sales,” said Murphy. “With NetSuite, we have a partner in the business as we continue to scale and serve the students, faculty and alumni of Harvard and MIT for the next century.”

Oracle Announces Java 18
New release delivers thousands of performance, stability, and security improvements, and nine JDK Enhancement Proposals
Austin, Texas—March 22, 2022
Oracle today announced the availability of Java 18, the latest version of the world’s number one programming language and development platform. Java 18 (Oracle JDK 18) delivers thousands of performance, stability, and security improvements, including nine enhancements to the platform that will further improve developer productivity.
The latest Java Development Kit (JDK) provides updates and improvements with nine JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs). These include the capability to add Code Snippets in Java API Documentation (JEP 413), which simplifies the addition of sample source code in API documentation, and Simple Web Server (JEP 408) for prototyping and testing. Developers can explore two incubating modules: the Vector API (JEP 417) and the Foreign Function and Memory API (JEP 419), as well as a preview feature: Pattern Matching for Switch (JEP 420).
“The release of Java 18 demonstrates Oracle’s continued commitment to provide enterprises and developers faster access to enhancements with the six-month feature release cadence,” said Georges Saab, Vice President of Development, Java Platform Group, Oracle. “We continue to make technical investments that improve the performance, stability, and security of the Java SE Platform implementations, as well as the Java Development Kit.”
“Java developers want continued innovation with modern programming language features, developer experience enhancements, cloud managed services, and stability,” said James Governor, Principal Analyst, RedMonk. “With Java’s consistent six-month release cadence Oracle is meeting those demands, helping to keep Java relevant for modern applications and workloads.”
  Accelerating Java’s Adoption in the Cloud
Oracle recently introduced Java Management Service (JMS), a new Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) native service to help manage Java runtimes and applications on-premises or on any cloud. JMS delivers the information needed to manage Java deployments across the enterprise. Java Management Service is included for OCI workloads and for Java SE Subscribers.
Java 18 is the latest release under Java’s six-month release cadence and is the result of extensive collaboration between Oracle engineers and other members of the worldwide Java developer community via the OpenJDK Project and the Java Community Process (JCP). This provides a steady stream of innovations while also delivering continued performance, stability and security improvements that will increase Java’s pervasiveness across organizations and industries of all sizes. The largest changes delivered in Java 18 are:
  Updates and Improvements to Libraries
JEP 400: UTF-8 by Default—Sets UTF-8 as the default charset of the standard Java APIs. With this change, APIs that depend on the default charset will behave consistently across all implementations, operating systems, locales, and configurations.
JEP 408: Simple Web Server—A command-line tool and API to start a minimal web server that serves static files only. This tool will be useful for prototyping, ad-hoc coding, and testing purposes, particularly in educational contexts.
JEP 416: Reimplement Core Reflection with Method Handles—Reimplements java.lang.reflect.Method, Constructor, and Field on top of java.lang.invoke method handles. By making method handles the underlying mechanism for reflection, it reduces the maintenance and development cost of both the java.lang.reflect and java.lang.invoke APIs.
JEP 418: Internet-Address Resolution SPI—Defines a service-provider interface (SPI) for host name and address resolution, so that java.net.InetAddress can make use of resolvers other than the platform's built-in resolver.
  Tools
JEP 413: JEP Code Snippets in Java API Documentation—Introduces the @snippet tag for JavaDoc’s Standard Doclet to simplify the inclusion of example source code in API documentation.
  Preview and Incubators for Later JDK Releases
JEP 417: Vector API (Third Incubator)—Provides an API for developers to reliably leverage CPU architectures that provide scalable vector extensions.  This will lead to superior performance compared to equivalent computations on non-extended processors. 
JEP 419: Foreign Function and Memory API (Second Incubator)—Enables Java programs to interoperate with code and data outside of the Java runtime. By efficiently invoking foreign functions (i.e., code outside the JVM), and by safely accessing foreign memory (i.e., memory not managed by the JVM), the API enables Java programs to call native libraries and process native data without the brittleness and pitfalls of JNI.
JEP 420: Pattern Matching for Switch (Second Preview)—Enhances the Java programming language with pattern matching for switch expressions and statements, along with extensions to the language of patterns. Extending pattern matching to switch allows an expression to be tested against a number of patterns, each with a specific action, so that complex data-oriented queries can be expressed concisely and safely. 
  Future Proofing Java Programs
JEP 421: Deprecate Finalization for Removal—Finalization remains enabled by default for now, but can be disabled to facilitate testing. In a future release, it will be disabled by default, and in a later release, it will be removed. Maintainers of libraries and applications that rely upon finalization should consider migrating to other resource management techniques such as the try-with-resources statement and cleaners.
  Supporting Java Customers
The Oracle Java SE Subscription, a predictable pay-as-you-go offering, provides customers with best in class support, entitlement to GraalVM Enterprise, access to the Java Management Service, and the flexibility to upgrade at the pace of their business. This helps IT organizations manage complexity, contain costs, and mitigate security risks.

Houston Food Bank Selects NetSuite to Help Fight Hunger
NetSuite helps nonprofit organization expand operations as it fights food insecurity exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic
Austin, Texas—March 17, 2022
The Houston Food Bank, the nation’s largest food bank in distribution, has selected Oracle NetSuite to help support its rapid expansion as it works to meet increases in demand for food and other essentials. With NetSuite, the Houston Food Bank will unify financial planning, order management, and warehouse logistics into a singular system to help give greater visibility and control into its operations and scale its programs that currently help more than one million people fight food insecurity.
Founded in 1982, the Houston Food Bank is a member of Feeding America and serves 18 counties in Houston and southeast Texas, distributing more than 150 million pounds of food annually through a network of 1,600 partners. To meet growing demand since the beginning of the global pandemic, the Houston Food Bank has increased distributions by 20 percent and as it scaled its operations, its current ERP system struggled to keep up. This led to inventory tracking issues, increased time spent on cycle counts, and slower fulfillment. To address these challenges and create more efficient operations so that it can help more people, the Houston Food Bank replaced its legacy ERP system with NetSuite.
“When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we had to rethink how we operated for the safety of all involved. We mobilized and set up neighborhood drive-through super sites to distribute food in larger quantities more efficiently, while maintaining safe distances,” said Casey Ferrell, senior director of information technology, Houston Food Bank. “As we scaled operations and revamped our processes, the inefficiencies of our ERP system became more pronounced. We made the switch to NetSuite because we knew we needed one unified system that could integrate data from across our business and automate our critical processes. NetSuite will give us the real-time visibility and insights needed in one central location to help support our growth trajectory and allow us to continue helping more Texans.”
With NetSuite, Houston Food Bank will be able to take advantage of an integrated business system to adapt and scale its core operations. NetSuite will enable Houston Food Bank to process orders faster through a new online ordering portal, while granting partners greater visibility and flexibility into their orders. Additionally, NetSuite inventory management will enable warehouse staff to cut down on cycle counts and more easily move and track product around the warehouse. Finally, by helping to eliminate manual processes across finance and operations, NetSuite will enable volunteers to spend more time identifying people in need and scaling home delivery operations in a way that caters to the dietary and cultural needs of those it serves.
“We are incredibly proud to work with organizations like the Houston Food Bank that make a positive difference in the world every day,” said Sam Levy, SVP of sales, Oracle NetSuite. “With NetSuite, the Houston Food Bank has one system of record to manage data from across critical business functions, putting it in a stronger position as it works toward its ultimate vision of a world without food insecurity.”

Oracle Announces Support for Autonomous and Non-Autonomous Databases on the same Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer
Multi-VM Autonomous Database enables organizations to more easily adopt Oracle Autonomous Database at a lower cost
Provides developers with a complete and simple self-service database for new applications
Allows customers to increase database consolidation benefits
Austin, Texas—March 16, 2022
Oracle today announced availability of Multiple-VM Autonomous Database on Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer. Multiple-VM Autonomous Database enables organizations to create and run isolated, highly available Autonomous Database instances on Exadata Cloud@Customer systems that are also running non-autonomous Oracle Databases. This helps customers lower costs through better infrastructure utilization and makes it easier for customers to adopt Autonomous Database. Multiple-VM Autonomous Database is available at no charge via an over-the-air update for existing Exadata Cloud@Customer customers.
With Multiple-VM Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer, organizations can set up isolated autonomous database environments for dev-test, staging, and production that implement different access rules, quotas, and availability policies to meet corporate governance requirements. Application developers have instant access to a self-service database application development platform that delivers mission-critical capabilities while supporting all modern data types, workloads, and development styles. In addition, Multiple-VM Autonomous Database helps improve developer productivity by creating a private database as-a-service environment with auto-tuning, auto-scaling, and auto-management capabilities that reduce the amount of time and effort required to deliver data-driven applications.
“We are focused on dramatically simplifying data management for all data-driven applications regardless of complexity, scale, criticality, or sensitivity,” said Juan Loaiza, executive vice president, Mission Critical Database Technologies, Oracle. “With Autonomous Database running on the same Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure as non-autonomous databases, customers can easily deploy new Autonomous Databases, and upgrade existing databases to Autonomous Database when they are ready.”
“Autonomous Database running on VMs in Exadata Cloud@Customer is a big win for developers,” said Holger Mueller, principal analyst and vice president, Constellation Research. “They can carve up VM clusters for self-service dev-test, staging, and production environments with appropriate SLAs, quotas, performance, and access characteristics. This capability combined with auto-provisioning, auto-tuning, and auto-patching as well as the converged support for all modern data types, workloads and development styles of the Autonomous Database frees developers to achieve higher velocity.” 
“Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer was already at least two generations ahead of the hybrid cloud offerings you could buy from the likes of AWS, Google and Azure,” said Ron Westfall, senior analyst and research director, Futurum. “Now, adding the ability to run thousands of Autonomous Databases in VMs across a single Exadata Cloud@Customer enables organizations to leverage fine-grained auto-scaling to only pay for CPU usage when it’s consumed—instead of paying for peak CPU usage all the time, like nearly every other hybrid cloud on the market. And considering that Snowflake doesn’t even have a hybrid cloud offering, they just fell even further behind.”
Leveraging Oracle Exadata infrastructure for performance, scalability, and availability, Multiple-VM Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer makes it simpler to deploy cloud-native and mission-critical databases. Exadata Cloud@Customer has been successfully deployed by organizations worldwide, including Algar Telecom, Caja Los Andes, Deutsche Bank, Lalux, MacMaster University, Maxim’s, MoMRAH, n11.com, and Texas A&M University to achieve cloud benefits faster with lower complexity, risk, and expense.
Customers across the globe have access to Multiple-VM Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer today via the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) console and APIs. It provides a consistent experience with that of the Oracle public cloud, but running on-premises in the customer’s data center to satisfy data residency and security requirements.

New flexible block storage volumes automatically tune the performance characteristics in response to fluctuating demand—a first for the industry
Compute options for most workloads from a fractional single-core VM that can burst to full-core performance to an entire HPC cluster with high-speed interconnects
Global organizations, including Vodafone, Samsung Securities, GoTo and Cox Automotive use OCI to run all types of workloads with significantly better price-performance
Austin, Texas—March 15, 2022
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is expanding with 11 new compute, networking, and storage services and capabilities that enable customers to run their workloads faster and more securely at lower costs. New offerings provide customers with truly flexible core infrastructure services, automatically optimizing resources to match application requirements and significantly reduce costs. Leading global organizations including Vodafone, Samsung Securities, GoTo and Cox Automotive rely on OCI to run all types of workloads, from microservices to AI.
Global cloud adoption continues to expand rapidly as business models transform and the demand for secure remote technology accelerates. However, a variety of prevailing public cloud misconceptions are still holding companies back from realizing the full benefits of the cloud. For instance, one commonly held belief is that customers have to re-write their applications for the cloud and deal with complex pricing models to reap the benefits of cloud computing. Additionally, many organizations believe that a series of different technology choices have to be made as they scale their operations. With today’s announcement, OCI is providing customers with even more simplicity and flexibility so that scaling can be affordable and easy without painstaking re-writes.
“OCI continues to break the rules in the cloud, helping customers run their workloads faster, more securely, and more economically,” said Clay Magouyrk, executive vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. “Customers can build cloud native apps on OCI with support for open, standards-based Kubernetes, while AI and high-performance computing customers can build some of the fastest computing clusters in the cloud.”
  OCI Unveils New Innovations Across Compute, Networking and Storage
OCI Compute gives customers the option to deploy on bare metal or virtual machines. OCI bare metal instances deliver high performance to enterprise applications, which gives customers maximum control and isolation. Flexible virtual machines enable customers to maximize total cost of ownership from their workloads with features, such as flexible memory, sub-core burstable CPU, and preemptible instances, enabling them to tune and take advantage of compute elasticity so they consume only what they need. The ability to scale within a compute instance, as well as scale out by adding more instances, enables customers to gain elasticity without re-writing their applications and reduces the risk and costs of migrating to the cloud. New services include:
Container Instances: Enables customers to use containers without directly managing the hosting VM or requiring Kubernetes orchestration. OCI takes care of creating the instance with a secure OS image, networking and storage.
AMD E4.Dense Compute Instances: Enables customer workloads that benefit from attached NVMe drives that provide low-latency storage. This includes database workloads (e.g., relational databases, NoSQL databases), virtualized direct-attached storage, caching, and data warehousing.
Oracle Cloud VMware Solution on AMD: Provides customers with new AMD-based 32, 64 and 128 core options, providing them with industry-leading VM deployment density options per SDDC host, which cater to high CPU or high memory use cases. OCI delivers over 2.5x the memory and CPUs per host than other offerings.
OCI Networking helps customers connect securely to OCI’s virtual cloud network (VCN) and dynamically create isolated, secure environments for their workloads. All necessary capabilities, including application firewalls, load balancing, and network peering have been streamlined to simplify provisioning and management. In addition, flexible load balancing throughout the network stack enables customers to optimize their performance and costs. As a result, OCI Networking can handle global scale networking workloads with some of the lowest costs in the market. New services and capabilities include:
Content Delivery Network (CDN) Interconnect: Establishes direct peering connections with select third-party CDN providers to offer no cost outbound bandwidth for OCI Object Storage. Origin-to-CDN costs are a significant portion of overall CDN costs and OCI is dramatically reducing those costs for customers, even for third-party CDNs. OCI currently offers this capability in North America for Cloudflare CDN.
Content Delivery Network (CDN) Service: Enables customers to deliver digital content to end users from a nearby location in a geographically distributed network. Customers benefit from integrated APIs, console, UCM billing and stronger integrations between OCI Object Storage, Compute and CDN to reduce origin-server-to-CDN egress fees.
Flexible Web Application Firewall (WAF): Enables customers to define a single WAF policy to protect applications from common exploits (e.g., OWASP Top 10) and enforce the policy on load balancer or on the edge.
Web Application Acceleration (WAA): Supports caching and compression of web HTTP responses in load balancer.
Network Visualizer: Allows customers to perform a configuration-based connectivity check and visualize the network path(s) along with information about the virtual network entities in the path. This helps customers identify and fix common virtual network misconfigurations.
vTAP: Enables OCI Network packet capture and inspection out of band to facilitate troubleshooting, security analysis, and data monitoring without impacting performance.
OCI Storage gives customers high-performance and low-cost cloud storage options through object, file, block, and archive storage. A single type of block volume serves every workload type, from lowest cost to highest performance, and is reconfigurable on-the-fly without disrupting workloads. This results in a flexible service that can serve even the highest SLA enterprise applications at up to 95 percent lower cost than other cloud offerings. New services and capabilities include:
Flexible Block Volumes with Performance-based Auto-tuning: Enables customers to change the performance characteristics of block storage volumes automatically in response to fluctuating demand. This is a unique capability in the cloud market today and helps customers meet peak demands automatically, and helps reduce storage costs when demand is low.
High Availability ZFS: Packages the ZFS file server in a highly available, automated deployment stack that uses OCI Block Volumes for the underlying raw storage.
  Customer and Analyst Commentary
“We selected OCI to run our video conferencing,” said Sascha Kuemmel, vice president, Technology Strategy, GoTo. “Moving this workload required zero re-writing of applications because of OCI’s Kubernetes compatibility and networking features. We saved 50 percent on our IT costs through more efficient use of resources and lower bandwidth fees.”
“OCI has enabled us to increase the number of Monte Carlo simulations we are able to run by 25 percent,” said Ian Brunton, Application Development Group Leader, Oracle Red Bull Racing. “By leveraging a modern technology stack, utilising the power and flexibility of Kubernetes, we can scale up our simulation platform whilst keeping costs within the tight spending regulations defined by the sport.”
“We’re running hundreds of bare metal GPUs connected in an RDMA cluster network with a shared file system to train AI models,” said Jonas Andrulis, CEO and Founder, Aleph Alpha. “OCI’s ability to cluster hundreds of bare metal CPUs and GPUs with low latency creates a robust environment that provides us with over 140 teraflops of training performance on demand, and at a much lower cost.”
“We moved our Oracle E-Business Suite to OCI and centralized our billing and settlement activities for our auto auctions, including Manheim, the world’s largest wholesale vehicle marketplace,” said Maria Riley, vice president, Corporate Systems, Cox Automotive. “We saved over $4.5 million per year and reduced the time it takes to put new code into production from two-and-a-half weeks to three days.”
“The promise of the cloud has always been paying for only what you need, but customers continue to over-provision due to rigid configuration options in most cloud platforms,” said Dave McCarthy, research vice president, Cloud and Edge Infrastructure Services, IDC. “OCI has made significant strides to address this problem by introducing new flexible compute, storage, and network infrastructure services over the last year. OCI customers can reduce costs by more accurately matching consumption to demand.”
These new OCI services and capabilities are planned for 2022.

From auto racing to AI, these four leaders bring very different workloads to OCI
Jeffrey Erickson | March 15, 2022 | 5 minute read
Director of tech content
Formula One race simulations. Self-learning artificial intelligence. Petabyte-scale video streaming. Real-time transactions for auctions. Behind the numbers that show accelerating demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) are stories like these, stories of the world’s leading companies bringing a huge range of workloads to OCI. From containers to AI to ERP, companies like GoTo, Aleph Alpha, Cox Automotive, and Oracle Red Bull Racing are thriving on OCI. Here are their stories:
GoTo runs petabyte-scale streaming and lowers costs with flexible compute
Remote work pioneer GoTo migrated its global GoToMeeting video workload to OCI, which helped the company improve performance and cut costs by 50%. With nearly 800,000 businesses worldwide as customers, and tens of millions of active users, GoTo runs at petabyte scale on OCI, including multiple Kubernetes clusters across three cloud regions to provide low-latency access. OCI’s flexible, on-demand capabilities help GoTo maintain performance while reducing costs. “We were able to make use of Oracle’s flexible compute capabilities to match our workload needs precisely,” says Sascha Kuemmel, vice president of technology strategy. “Our workloads are very dynamic, due to the usage pattern of our customers. The reasonably priced on-demand model for compute in OCI is a perfect fit.”
OCI also helped GoTo save time and effort during the migration process. “We were able to simply extend our Kubernetes architecture on OCI without significant additional coding,” Kuemmel says. OCI's network and security design, and its native Terraform automation, allow just two GoTo employees bring up entire regions in less than 24 hours. “The Oracle team has been a great partner in closing any remaining gaps and making the platform a perfect fit for our requirements.”
(Hear these industry leaders tell their stories on Oracle Live.)
Aleph Alpha builds self-learning AI using teraflops of training performance on demand
Headquartered in Heidelberg, Germany, Aleph Alpha researches, develops, and operationalizes large generalizable AI models that have the potential to solve humanity’s greatest challenges. To do that, the firm teamed with OCI to build its billion-parameter AI models.

 
Part of Aleph Alpha’s unique challenge was that it needed a high-security cloud provider, while also getting the best price-performance for intensive computing, says Jonas Andrulis, Aleph Alpha’s CEO and founder. OCI gives Aleph Alpha the freedom to cluster hundreds of bare metal CPUs and GPUs with low latency, creating a robust environment to pre-process and train its models. “OCI Compute provided the features we needed,” Andrulis says, including hundreds of GPUs with high-speed interconnect. “The ability to get over 140 teraflops of training performance on demand, and economically, has accelerated our work.”
Cox Automotive saves $4.5 million annually using automation and elastic scaling
Atlanta-based Cox Automotive implemented OCI to run several high-volume, back-office enterprise applications, including Oracle E-Business Suite on Oracle Exadata Cloud Service. This includes a real-time transaction engine that’s essentially the cash register for Manheim, the world’s largest wholesale vehicle marketplace, and a Cox Automotive business.
By consolidating and digitizing information related to vehicle transactions, Cox Automotive has changed the way the world buys, sells, owns, and uses vehicles. Known for its brands such as Autotrader, Kelley Blue Book, Manheim, and vAuto, Cox Automotive uses its unmatched data sets across the industry to provide insights and create services that connect dealers, lenders, and consumers in new ways.
Cox Automotive saved more than $4.5 million annually on back-office operations with OCI, in part due to the flexibility of the infrastructure, says Robert Taylor, lead back-office architect for Cox Automotive. For example, the company uses the powerful Oracle Exadata Cloud Service only during workday hours, turning it off on nights and weekends. Cox Automotive has been able to continually test automations, resulting in increased elasticity of its OCI infrastructure, such as provisioning 60 compute nodes to run for 2 hours at night and then shut down, or dial up the IOPS for Block Volumes only when needed instead of paying to provision them 24/7, as the company would in other clouds. “With OCI, we run workloads specific to the task at hand, save money, and gain reliability,” Taylor says. “Our customers can rely on our product, and we rely on OCI.”
Formula 1 racing team runs billions of simulations on OCI’s Arm-based virtual servers
World-champion Formula One race team Oracle Red Bull Racing uses OCI to analyze data for strategy decisions in real time and at scale. “For every lap and every corner that you turn, you’re always learning, capturing hundreds of data points a second,” says Ian Brunton, application development group leader for Oracle Red Bull Racing and Red Bull Technology. “We needed to make faster real-time decisions during races to get a competitive advantage, such as the best time to make a pit stop to change tires.”
To do this, Red Bull Racing ran its strategy simulations on OCI using Kubernetes and containers on Ampere Arm-based virtual servers. Using OCI let Red Bull Racing run about 25% more simulations during a race, giving strategists better insights to help them make the right call.
These simulations supported race strategists as they made decisions that ultimately helped achieve a winning performance in 2021, when drivers Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez collected 23 podium finishes, and Verstappen was crowned the F1 Drivers’ Champion. “With Oracle, we continue to be the most forward-thinking and innovative F1 team in the world,” says Brunton.
On March 15th, Oracle Vice President Leo Leung and these four industry leaders presented via Oracle Live about core infrastructure features that help them run applications faster, more securely, and with improved economics.

Oracle Helps Field Service Teams Deliver Consistent and Efficient Service with New Workflow Manager
By Jeff Wartgow, vice president, product management, Oracle Service—March 14, 2022
Companies in telecommunications, utilities, manufacturing, and other industries that provide services via mobile workers are facing two compounding challenges.
First, a generational shift is taking place across their workforces, which is resulting in the most tenured field service team members retiring or leaving the field. As they leave, they are taking with them vast experience, best practices, and decades of earned “know-how” for getting things done.
Second, services are getting increasingly complex. Not only is equipment becoming more technical and connected, but it is also being updated and serviced more frequently than in the past. As a result, service processes must adapt, and field service teams need on-going training and upskilling.
To help our customers address these challenges while continuing to deliver high quality service, we are introducing Workflow Manager within Oracle Field Service, a part of Oracle Advertising and Customer Experience (CX).
With Workflow Manager, our customers will:
Improve Productivity: Using a preconfigured set of steps for initiating service, diagnosing issues, performing repairs, as well as customer debriefing and upselling enables inexperienced field service workers to complete routine tasks consistently and without extensive training.
Ensure Quality: Workflows deliver visual guidance to field service teams to complete the steps in a specific order and ensure safety, compliance, and quality.
Enhance Visibility: Each completed step is recorded to provide real-time monitoring of the progress of a job. As a result, supervisors and dispatchers can view the progress and status of a service activity without disrupting the field service technician.
Oracle Field Service helps schedule, route, and equip mobile workers so they can complete service activities at a customer’s home, office, or installed asset location. The addition of Workflow Manager improves the consistency of service delivery, no matter the level of experience of the field service technician.
Oracle Field Service customers have access to Workflow Manager today.

Institution to implement Oracle Student Financial Planning to automate financial aid activities to provide a better experience for students and administrators
Austin, Texas—March 14, 2022
The University of Texas at Austin has selected Oracle Student Financial Planning (SFP) to make it easier for students to apply for and receive financial aid. Part of Oracle Student Cloud, the solution helps applicants navigate the process with step-by-step guidance and provides a personalized view of funding options to best inform borrowing decisions. It also gives administrators real-time eligibility insights to guide students and improve application completion rates.
“As an institution founded to advance the public good, UT Austin is deeply committed to making higher education accessible to all students who are academically qualified, regardless of their financial means to support social mobility,” said Brian Dixon, vice provost of enrollment management, UT Austin. “Working alongside Oracle, we are committed to delivering an exceptional financial aid experience to our students and prospects throughout their academic journey.”
Established in 1883, UT Austin is one of the nation’s top universities. The campus is home to approximately 50,000 students – 32,000 of whom are financial aid recipients. Currently, UT Austin uses a homegrown financial aid system to process and disburse student aid. In light of federally-mandated changes to financial aid processes and upcoming institutional initiatives, the university sought a new solution to streamline the aid experience for students and administrators. After a competitive review, UT Austin opted for Oracle Student Financial Planning due to its proven market success.
By automating approximately 90% of financial aid processes from beginning to end, Student Financial Planning will help UT Austin smooth and improve the entire financial aid process. This includes determining eligibility, packaging, and awarding aid, through to disbursements and reporting. Not only will this support students to more easily get the right financial aid for their needs, but will free administrators from manual tasks so they can rededicate time to more individualized student support.
“Financial aid is integral to attracting and retaining students, and equipping them with the resources necessary to realize their personal, professional, and academic goals,” said Vivian Wong, group vice president, higher education development, Oracle. “UT Austin is dedicated to its core purpose—to transform lives for the benefit of society—and Oracle Student Financial Planning will be a key asset in contributing to that purpose.”

Oracle Announces Fiscal 2022 Third Quarter Financial Results
Total Revenue $10.5 billion, up 4% and up 7% in constant currency
Total Cloud Revenue (IaaS plus SaaS) of $2.8 billion, up 24% and up 26% in constant currency
Fusion ERP Cloud Revenue up 33% and up 35% in constant currency
NetSuite ERP Cloud Revenue up 27% and up 29% in constant currency
Austin, Texas—March 10, 2022
Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) today announced fiscal 2022 Q3 results. Total quarterly revenues were up 4% year-over-year in USD and up 7% in constant currency to $10.5 billion. Cloud services and license support revenues were up 5% in USD and up 8% in constant currency to $7.6 billion. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues were up 1% in USD and up 4% in constant currency to $1.3 billion.
Q3 GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, down 1% in USD and up 3% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, up 1% in USD and up 4% in constant currency. GAAP operating margin was 36%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 46%. GAAP net income was $2.3 billion, and non-GAAP net income was $3.1 billion.
Q3 GAAP earnings per share was $0.84 while non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.13, down 3% in USD and up 1% in constant currency. Q3 earnings per share was lowered by $0.05 primarily because of a decline in the share price of revolutionary gene sequencing company Oxford Nanopore, and an operating loss at Ampere, the maker of the world’s fastest ARM Server Chips.  We remain confident that our investments in these two cutting-edge technology companies will deliver very strong returns for Oracle.
Short-term deferred revenues were $7.9 billion. Operating cash flow was $10.4 billion during the trailing twelve months.
“In Q3, Oracle delivered over 7% constant currency revenue growth—our highest quarterly organic revenue growth rate since we began our transition to the cloud,” said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz. “This strong top line growth was coupled with a solid non-GAAP constant currency operating profit growth of 4%, but the big story is that our overall revenue growth is being driven by both our rapidly growing Cloud Infrastructure and Cloud Applications businesses. Q3 Cloud Infrastructure revenue was up 47% in constant currency.  Q3 Cloud Applications growth was led by Fusion ERP, which was up 35% in constant currency and NetSuite ERP which was up 29% in constant currency. Total Cloud revenue which includes Cloud Infrastructure and Cloud Applications is now over $11 billion a year.”
“In Q3, Oracle completed development of the multi-cloud version of our MySQL HeatWave open-source database,” said Oracle Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison. “The MySQL HeatWave database is already running in the Oracle Gen2 Cloud. In a few weeks, MySQL HeatWave will also be available in the Amazon Cloud and the Microsoft Azure Cloud. MySQL HeatWave was designed to compete with Amazon’s version of MySQL called Aurora, Snowflake and other popular cloud databases. What customer and database analysts are saying about Oracle’s new MySQL HeatWave database is simply astonishing.  Here are a couple of examples of what the database analysts are saying.”
“Oracle have shown AWS, Snowflake and other database providers how to design and architect a True MySQL Cloud Database. Customers can expect MySQL HeatWave to perform about 7 times faster than Amazon Redshift or Snowflake at 2-5 times lower cost. The benefits over Amazon Aurora are even greater.”
The following is an approved quote from the database analysts at Wikibon:
“We believe that the technology underlying MySQL HeatWave is an inflection point in database design and architecture. The MySQL HeatWave technology is by far the best in the market now, and we believe that the MySQL HeatWave competitive advantage is sustainable for at least three years. We also believe customers will demand that AWS provide similar converged functionality as HeatWave.”
The board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share of outstanding common stock. This dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 8, 2022, with a payment date of April 21, 2022.

"Feb 24, 2022",Oracle Helps Organizations Secure HR Data with AI-Driven Alerts,https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/blog/oracle-helps-organizations-secure-hr-data-ai-alerts-2022-02-24/,"Blog
Oracle Helps Organizations Secure HR Data with AI-Driven Alerts
By Yvette Cameron, SVP of global product strategy, Oracle Cloud HCM—February 24, 2022
As HR systems have evolved, organizations have collected and uploaded nearly everything there is to know about each of their employees. From compensation, home addresses, and bank account information to national identification numbers, disability status, and performance data—organizations host a substantial amount of high-risk data on their workforce.
This data is highly valuable for organizations and employees, but it is also a huge draw to cybercriminals and other malicious actors—even from within the organization. And those bad actors are trying their best to access it. Over the course of 2020, there were more than 5,200 known incidents of lost or stolen data, privilege misuse and systems intrusions against organizations, many of which originated from people with legitimate credentials within the organization.
That is why I am excited to announce Oracle Advanced HCM Controls, part of Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM), an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered monitoring solution that automates security analysis to protect against fraud and help ensure that only the people who need to use sensitive data have access to it. With Oracle Advanced HCM Controls, HR leaders have better visibility into potential fraud or compliance issues within their systems and can review and block suspicious activity as it occurs.
The new updates include AI-powered anomaly detection and alerts to help HR leaders and security teams monitor and respond to potential threats, including suspicious employee activity, phishing attacks, bot activity or data breaches targeting HR data and processes. The new updates monitor and detect activity based on:
Time and Frequency: Instant alerts about suspicious activity are now sent based on when and how often sensitive HR records are being accessed. This enables HR teams to quickly detect abnormal activity in the system, such as an employee accessing data over the weekend to signal that an account may be compromised or individuals are acting in bad faith. In addition, HR teams will be immediately alerted if large amounts of data are being accessed in a short period of time. For example, clicking through data faster than a human can read may be a sign of fraudulent activity, such as a bot being used to collect HR data.
Location: Instant alerts about suspicious activity are now sent based on where sensitive HR records are being accessed from. For example, if an account is logged in from two geographically distant locations at once or if the system shows that a user is logged in from a country they have never visited, it will automatically trigger an alert to address it.
Role and Responsibility: Instant alerts about suspicious activity are now sent based on who is accessing the data. For example, if someone is transferred to a different department, they may still have previous privileges to access sensitive data that they no longer need in their new role. In addition, it will also immediately alert HR teams about suspicious activity based on the level of the role, such as if a senior executive is accessing data typically used by more junior employees.
In addition to helping HR leaders quickly identify and respond to potential security threats as soon as they occur, the new capabilities also automate compliance reporting to help security teams focus on assessing and responding to immediate risks. And what’s more, because the new capabilities are embedded in Oracle Cloud HCM and powered by machine learning, they continuously develop a better understanding of normal and abnormal behavior over time.
HR teams are entrusted with extraordinary amounts of sensitive data, often needing to store and protect personally identifiable information for thousands of employees. As access and use of data has become more automated over time, so too has the need for teams to automate the way that they secure that data.
In order to help our customers stay one step ahead of malicious actors and stop suspicious activity whenever, wherever and whoever it comes from, we are committed to providing our customers tools like Oracle Advanced HCM Controls that give them the visibility and automation they need to safeguard their data, their employees, and their organization.

"Feb 16, 2022",Oracle Introduces Supplier Rebate Management to Help Healthcare Organizations Maximize Profitability and Drive Business Growth,https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/blog/oracle-channel-revenue-management-product-update-2022-02-16/,"Blog
Oracle Introduces Supplier Rebate Management to Help Healthcare Organizations Maximize Profitability and Drive Business Growth
By Derek Gittoes, VP of Supply Chain Management Product Strategy, Oracle—February 16, 2022
Healthcare organizations face several challenges in growing their businesses, and many of them stem from the complexities of managing suppliers.
Decision making in healthcare is often driven by contracted sales and is heavily influenced by distributors, group purchasing organizations, managed care organizations, and government regulations. As a result, managing supplier relationships and medical supplies is a constant challenge, which has been compounded by recent global supply chain issues—and getting the right supplies to the right facilities on time is only half the battle.
The other half of the battle is controlling rising costs with suppliers, and many healthcare organizations are stuck relying on error-prone manual processes to manage their supplier rebate programs—which can lead to costly mistakes. This is a significant challenge that can result in lost revenue, as healthcare organizations often depend on suppliers to calculate and issue rebates, and they don’t have any visibility to validate the accuracy of rebates. In fact, at least four percent of potential rebate revenue goes unclaimed every year.
  Deep Insights Into Rebate Programs Lead to Greater Profitability
To help healthcare organizations address these challenges, we are introducing Supplier Rebate Management, a new solution within Oracle Fusion Cloud Channel Revenue Management. 
Part of Oracle Fusion Cloud Supply Chain & Manufacturing (SCM), Channel Revenue Management automates trade program processes and settlement in the cloud. By simplifying rebate programs, Supplier Rebate Management will enable our healthcare customers to maximize their revenue potential by helping them to:
Improve and Optimize Cash Flow: Through full integration with Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), the new solution delivers real-time data and information on customers’ rebate programs to help them make more strategic purchasing decisions, improve financial forecasting, track and calculate rebate funds more accurately, and help ensure that funds are earned and received on time. This helps customers minimize the risk of missing rebate program revenue targets, receive rebate funds faster with fewer errors, and invest those funds immediately where needed – and eliminates the need for organizations to rely on third-party agencies to manage and collect rebates.
Reallocate Valuable Organizational Resources: With full integration with Oracle Cloud ERP, Oracle Fusion Cloud Procurement, Oracle Fusion Cloud Order Management, and Oracle Fusion Cloud Inventory Management, Supplier Rebate Management enables customers to manage the entire supplier rebate lifecycle, from rebate contract, program management, and tracking to performance analysis. In addition, by providing a complete, automated solution, it eliminates many previously manual and time-consuming rebate program processes. As a result, our healthcare customers can reallocate their employees’ valuable time to focus on more strategic tasks.
Strengthen Relationships with Suppliers and Partners: Through real-time insights into purchasing, pricing, and rebate earnings information across multiple rebate programs, Supplier Rebate Management helps our healthcare customers work more collaboratively and improve negotiations with suppliers and partners.
There doesn’t appear to be any end in sight to the global supply chain disruptions—in fact, a recent Oracle survey found that two-thirds of people are scared that these supply chain issues will never end. And considering that better operational health and greater profitability often lead to better patient care, my team is committed to helping our healthcare customers maximize their revenue potential and grow their businesses via Oracle Channel Revenue Management and the new Supplier Rebate Management offering.

US DoD Accredits Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) for Top Secret Missions
Austin, Texas—February 15, 2022
Oracle today announced the US Department of Defense (DoD) has authorized Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to host Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information (TS/SCI) and Special Access Program (SAP) missions. This expands on Oracle’s growing number of accreditations, currently serving government workloads up to FedRAMP High and DoD Impact Level 5.
The DoD will use Oracle National Security Regions (ONSR), which are dedicated Oracle Cloud Infrastructure regions isolated from the internet and connected to only government-specified networks that meet requisite security classifications. DoD assessors granted the Authority to Operate (ATO) which will enable secure processing of some of the Air Force’s most sensitive data.  The Air Force uses a broad array of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services, such as OCI Container Engine for Kubernetes and Oracle Database Cloud Service. This includes using the spatial and graph functions within Oracle Exadata Cloud Service to accelerate data analysis.
Oracle has multiple National Security Regions, in addition to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s global network of US DoD, US FedRAMP, and commercial cloud regions. National Security Regions meet both ICD 705 and ICD 503 standards and are engineered to host missions at DISA Impact Level 6/Secret and Top-Secret security levels, with capabilities including strong encryption and security controls and in-depth auditing. The National Security Regions are designed to deliver identical cloud services to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure commercial regions.
“Oracle has long provided high performance, high availability, and open computing to the DoD and Intelligence Community to securely run their most-demanding, mission-critical classified workloads,” said Glen Dodson, senior vice president, National Security Group, Oracle. “Oracle’s broad data management services and analytics, including built-in AI, are immensely valuable additions to the DoD’s multi-cloud strategy.”  
Oracle is a long-standing strategic technology partner of the US Government. With a full range of data management services, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure supports the DoD data decrees and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Acceleration Initiative (ADA) with open data standards and an architecture powered by embedded machine learning. Many federal, state and local customers are using Oracle to deliver critical government services. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is used across the Department of Defense, including the US Army, Navy and Air Force, multiple defense agencies, as well as the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Globally, more than 1,000 public sector organizations are benefitting from Oracle’s industry-leading technologies and superior performance.

Vodafone UK Taps Oracle Tech to Support 5G Network Core
Oracle cloud native network policy solution to help Vodafone accelerate new 5G services
Austin, Texas and Newbury, UK—February 14, 2022
Vodafone UK has selected Oracle Communications to spearhead network policy for its standalone 5G network. With Oracle’s cloud native network policy management solution as part of its 5G core, Vodafone will be able to make more intelligent policy decisions and quickly test and deploy new services. This will help get exciting new 5G offerings into the hands of customers faster, ranging from holographic calls to 5G game streaming without lag time, and film downloads at up to 4X faster than 4G networks.
“Moving to ‘cloud native’ is a culture shift as much as it is a technology shift for a techcomms company like Vodafone,” said Andrea Dona, chief network officer, Vodafone UK. “Our partners must demonstrate flexibility and agility, as well as aligning to our vision of how technology will augment and support tomorrow’s digital society.”
  Powering the Heart of the Unbeatable Network
Converged policy management is comprised of the 5G Core Policy Control Function (PCF) and the Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF). The solution helps to dynamically prioritizes low-latency applications to edge data networks, while continuously optimizing network policies based on data analytics. For example, based on the data, the solution can help Vodafone customers get the network offering that best suits their needs, be it connecting smart devices, utilizing live streaming, or enabling AR/VR gaming. As such, Vodafone can provide a seamless experience across 4G and 5G networks while simultaneously delivering a smooth integration of new 5G services. The solution will be deployed by Oracle Communications consulting.
“5G undoubtedly opens the door for endless new ways to engage with our world, but intelligent policy management is the entryway to capitalize on these opportunities,” said Andrew Morawski, senior vice president and general manager, Oracle Communications, Networks. “Our 5G and cloud capabilities are helping Vodafone to build a future-proof network that is automated, easier to scale, simpler to operate, and more cost-effective.”
Aligned with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Oracle’s cloud native 5G core control plane features network functions, including the policy control, that help operators automate and scale to meet the expected growth in 5G subscribers and connected devices.

"Feb 14, 2022",Oracle Introduces New Logistics Capabilities to Help Customers Increase Supply Chain Efficiency and Value,https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-introduces-new-logistics-capabilities-2022-02-14/,"Press Release
Oracle Introduces New Logistics Capabilities to Help Customers Increase Supply Chain Efficiency and Value
New capabilities in Oracle Fusion Cloud Supply Chain & Manufacturing enable customers to minimize costs, reduce risk, improve customer experience, and navigate disruptions
Austin, Texas—February 14, 2022
To help organizations increase efficiency and value across their global supply chains, Oracle today announced new logistics management capabilities within Oracle Fusion Cloud Supply Chain & Manufacturing (SCM). The updates to Oracle Fusion Cloud Transportation Management and Oracle Fusion Cloud Global Trade Management can help organizations reduce costs and risk, improve customer experience, and become more adaptable to business disruptions.
The unpredictability of the past two years has created major logistics-related challenges for organizations as they navigate large fluctuations in supply and demand and major disruptions to their distribution networks. This has resulted in rising logistics costs and has also impacted organizations’ relationships with customers—in fact, a recent Oracle survey found that 87 percent of people have been negatively impacted by supply chain issues over the past year.
“Western Digital has multiple manufacturing locations in the U.S. and Asia, handling more than half a million shipments every year. Our supply chain ecosystem is extremely complex with multiple end markets each having unique service needs, and the disruptive events of the past two years added to that complexity on an exponential scale,” said Joseph Hodges, Director of Logistics Center of Excellence, Western Digital. “With Oracle Transportation Management as our foundation we have been able to streamline logistics processes and customer support, quickly achieving significant results—including reducing cost and service disruption through expansion of our partner base, implementing on-demand spot bidding, and dynamically shifting modes while operating with 90 percent touch-free automation in the last fiscal year. In addition, Oracle Transportation Management’s built-in machine learning capabilities have helped improve ETA accuracy from 64 percent to 93 percent, which is an invaluable result in terms of an improved customer experience.”
Oracle Transportation Management and Oracle Global Trade Management are continuously innovating to help organizations address logistics management challenges. Below are details on the new capabilities, which will help customers improve order fulfillment accuracy, reduce logistics costs, enhance the customer experience, and manage risk associated with unforeseen changes across their supply chains:
Intelligent Transit Time Predictions: A new machine learning algorithm in Oracle Transportation Management will enable users to evaluate the potential impact of both macro-level interruptions (including extreme weather or airport delays) and network-level disruptions (such as labor and capacity shortages). This can help customers more accurately predict delivery times and lower costs associated with delays, expedited shipments, and additional safety stock.
Enhanced Shipment Capabilities: Supply chain leaders can simplify and automate transportation processes for shipments. New capabilities include automated spot bidding and the ability to combine and track multiple shipments in Oracle Transportation Management, and automated global trade analysis on trade agreements in Oracle Global Trade Management. By automating and simplifying these previously manual processes, the new capabilities can help customers reduce human errors, freight costs, and shipment delays.
Multi-Language Digital Assistant: Real-time, multi-lingual response capabilities within Oracle Logistics Digital Assistant—a key feature across Oracle Transportation Management and Oracle Global Trade Management—enable organizations to provide faster and more accurate information and standardize responses to inquiries in their customers’ native languages. By offering high-quality, global customer service without the need for additional IT resources, organizations are able to reduce operational costs and quickly respond to customers, regardless of geographical location or language.
Advanced Transportation and Global Trade Analytics: New advanced analytics capabilities enable customers to quickly access, analyze, and interpret highly accurate transportation and global trade data. This helps to increase cost savings, improve logistics planning, and enable better-informed business decisions.
“While the volatile business environment of the past two years will continue to shape supply chain strategies, accurately managing the crucial transportation and shipping functions will always remain a top priority for our customers,” said Derek Gittoes, vice president of supply chain management product strategy, Oracle. “The new capabilities in Oracle Transportation Management and Oracle Global Trade Management deliver a double benefit, as they help customers streamline their logistics operations while minimizing the associated risks. With these capabilities, we’re underscoring our commitment to continuous innovation and helping our customers navigate today’s business landscape to continue growing their businesses.”
Oracle’s logistics solutions, including Oracle Transportation Management, Oracle Global Trade Management, and Oracle Fusion Cloud Warehouse Management, help customers manage sustainable transportation, global trade, and distribution processes. As a result, customers can maximize perfect order fulfillment and minimize logistics costs while navigating business disruptions.

Bangkok, Thailand—February 13, 2022
Clinixir Company Limited, a startup Clinical Research Organization (CRO) in Thailand, has selected Oracle’s innovative clinical research and pharmacovigilance solutions as its eClinical platform. Clinixir chose the Oracle Health Sciences Clinical One Cloud Service for its comprehensive, end-to-end technology capabilities and breadth of applications. It has also selected Oracle Argus for its safety management, amongst other Oracle applications.
Clinixir is the largest provider of clinical trial services to Thailand’s Ministry of Health, as well as several universities, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies. After careful evaluation, Clinixir has selected Oracle to help it run and optimize its clinical trial budgeting, planning and management, monitoring, and analytics. With Oracle, Clinixir will be able to establish a unified data platform for its clinical trial and safety operations and integrate its recently selected Oracle NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.
“After a thorough evaluation we found Oracle is the only vendor that provides an end-to-end solution from finance, enterprise resource planning (ERP), and operations to clinical trial and safety applications,” said Chief Executive Officer Dr. Kanokwan Pornprasit, Clinixir. “Oracle’s clinical research, pharmacovigilance and back-office products provide a single best-in-class solution and we are confident that we can conduct our clinical trials efficiently, effectively, and safely.”
Clinical One will harmonize data from multiple sources which will help Clinixir to streamline workflows and save significant time from study startup to study closeout. With Clinical One’s unified platform and applications Clinixir will have access to a complete analysis of clinical trial data, the patient’s experience, and ultimately, the safety and efficacy of the investigative therapy, and enable the CRO to make actionable decisions.
As part of its deployment, Clinixir will use: Oracle Argus, Oracle NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning, Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS) (known as Oracle Health Sciences Trial Management and Monitoring Cloud), Clinical Development Analytics (CDA), Oracle Health Sciences ClearTrial, Oracle Analytics Cloud, Oracle Database, and Oracle Clinical One for Electronic Data Collection (EDC) and Randomization and Trial Supply Management (RTSM).
“Thailand’s public sector is undergoing a major push for digitization,” said Managing Director Oracle Thailand Taveesak Saengthong, “As a CRO, Clinixir will be a valuable contributor to the health of Thailand’s residents as it works with top universities and other organisations to bring therapies to market quickly. At Oracle, we are very committed to supporting these important efforts through our technology.”
“The right technology is essential in helping CROs better manage and use data to speed discoveries of new treatments,” said Senior Vice President and General Manager Henry McNamara, Oracle Health Sciences. “The flexibility, speed, and real-time insights our platform and applications can deliver can help enable Clinixir to streamline its clinical trial operations.”

NetSuite Fosters Diversity and Inclusion in Entrepreneurship with New Accelerator Program
By George Ploss—February 10, 2022
Entrepreneurship is a key driver of innovation, opportunity and job growth and despite the challenging conditions over the past two years, a record number of new business applications were filed in 2020 and again in 2021 according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Diverse communities are playing an important role in this surge in entrepreneurship. For example, census data also showed that Black business creation reached an all-time high over the past two years.
Oracle NetSuite was founded more than two decades ago with the mission to help entrepreneurs unlock business growth. To help even more diverse businesses realize their vision, we are launching the NetSuite Accelerator program.
“What we’ve seen the past two years is similar to what we’ve seen in the last economic downturn: chaotic and uncertain times can often be the inspiration behind some of the greatest innovations,” said Evan Goldberg, founder and EVP, Oracle NetSuite. “Today, I am proud that we are launching the NetSuite Accelerator to invest in the creation, growth and success of the many businesses built by diverse communities.”
The NetSuite Accelerator program will initially focus on helping Black entrepreneurs and leaders build successful and sustainable businesses, but we are not stopping there and plan to launch programs for women, LGTBQ, Veteran, disabled, and LatinX communities within the next year.
Our first incubator partner is the Capital Factory in Austin, Texas, but we’ll continue to expand our partnerships working with incubators across the United States to identify entrepreneurs and leaders that will benefit from the program.
  Helping Diverse Communities
With 28,000+ customers and 1,000+ partners, the NetSuite Accelerator program will leverage the experiences learned from our global community to ensure that more entrepreneurs and leaders have greater access to the processes, best practices, guidance, and technology required to achieve the kind of sustainable growth that only comes from having visibility and control in their businesses.
The program will offer businesses the following investments and access:
Discounted Software: Entrepreneurs and leaders will gain access to NetSuite, a technology platform that will help their businesses grow, scale and adapt to change, at a significant discount that equates to tens of thousands of dollars each year.
Mentoring and Strategic Guidance: Entrepreneurs and leaders will gain advice and feedback from senior NetSuite executives, including NetSuite founder and executive vice president Evan Goldberg, as well as 1:1 guidance from subject matter experts from across the NetSuite engineering, sales, operations and marketing teams.  
Technical and Functional Support: Entrepreneurs and leaders will have access to strategic customer service functions for technical and functional support, at no cost. This will include a designated functional consultant and Customer Success Manager to help ensure key milestones are met in a timely fashion.
Community Engagement: Entrepreneurs and leaders will gain free access to educational events, including hackathons and buildathons, with their peers from across the NetSuite community to gain advice and discuss critical business challenges. 
Training and Education: Entrepreneurs and leaders will gain access to free NetSuite Certification Programs, which will enable business owners and their employees to become experts at unlocking our Suite.

Madrid, Spain and Austin, Texas—February 10, 2022
Oracle and Telefónica Tech today announced an agreement to jointly offer cloud platform-as-a-service and applications to enterprises and public sector organizations across Telefónica Tech’s customer base. The services will be delivered through a global partnership which will enable Telefónica Tech to offer Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services as part of its portfolio as well as support clients through professional and managed services.
To support the increasing demand for cloud services in Spain, Telefónica will also become the host partner for the Oracle Cloud Madrid Region. The new region will be designed to provide Spanish business and public sector customers with a broad and consistent set of cloud services with low latency, high performance, and the highest security standards. It will also help customers with business continuity and address their in-country data residency and compliance requirements. The Madrid region is Oracle’s first cloud region in Spain, and one of at least 44 cloud regions Oracle plans to open by the end of 2022, continuing one of the fastest expansions of any major cloud provider.
Telefónica Tech has one of the broadest portfolios of managed and professional cloud services in the market, including infrastructure- and platform-as-a-service offerings, with the ability to provide customized services that meet the needs of its customers with the best technologies available. The company has a highly-qualified team of more than 3,000 expert professionals with the highest certifications in cloud services and cybersecurity who provide services to Telefónica Group’s 5.5 million B2B customers in 175 countries.
With built-in security, superior performance, high availability and lower cost, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) provides a next-generation cloud infrastructure designed for mission-critical and cloud-native workloads in large enterprise and public sector environments. Oracle’s hybrid and multi-cloud strategy aligns closely with Telefonica’s goal of ensuring that all customer data is hosted regionally or in-country where possible, and customers have a cloud solution that meets their data sovereignty needs.
“With Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, we are complementing Telefonica’s robust cloud services offering with a cloud platform that has seen strong growth over the last year as customers all over the world use it to run their most mission-critical workloads in the cloud,” said Albert Triola, SVP & Country Leader Oracle Spain. “Our partnership with Telefonica also comes at a propitious moment for Spain, with the ongoing application of EU recovery funds to boost cloud adoption and business competitiveness in the country. This agreement reaffirms our commitment to providing Spanish businesses and public sector entities with a secure and scalable cloud services platform that helps accelerate the adoption of AI, machine learning and other new technologies in organizations of all sizes and sectors.”
""One of the key drivers for success in the cloud market is to help our customers in their digital transformation by offering a complete and differential portfolio with the support of reference partners. This agreement with Oracle will allow us to expand our cloud services and strengthen our strategic positioning in PaaS, as well as reinforce our value proposition in databases and middleware applications with one of the market leaders,"" said María Jesús Almazor, CEO of Cybersecurity & Cloud at Telefónica Tech.
Oracle and Telefónica España recently announced a multi-year agreement to migrate the operator’s mission-critical commercial and operational systems to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and accelerate the development of new communication services for consumers and businesses.

Oracle and Red Bull Racing have enhanced their partnership and are introducing a new Team name, Oracle Red Bull Racing, as well as the Team’s new car for the upcoming season, the RB18. Building on the success of last year’s F1 Drivers’ Championship, the Team’s 2022 season will feature expanded use of Oracle Cloud across its most significant areas of operation including analytics-based race strategy, optimized engine development, AI and machine learning-powered driver training and a tailored fan experience.
“Oracle Cloud enabled us to make race-day decisions that helped Max Verstappen win the 2021 Drivers’ Championship,” said Oracle Red Bull Racing Team Principal and CEO Christian Horner. “Discovering and reacting to opportunities quickly, is crucial to our success on and off the track, and Oracle is integral in that effort. Every element of our performance is driven by data analysis. Having Oracle as our title partner shows the confidence we have in their expertise and their ability to deliver a true competitive advantage.”
Taking advantage of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) during last season’s championship run, the Team increased the number of simulations they ran by 1,000x to improve the accuracy of their predictions and sharpen their decision-making. In addition, they accelerated simulation speed by 10x, which gave race strategists more time to make the right call. Equally important, OCI significantly reduced the cost of billions of simulations, allowing the Team to cost-effectively improve performance on the track, which is critical for success under F1’s stringent spending regulations.
This season, OCI will enable the Oracle Red Bull Racing Team to expand the volume and variety of data they analyze and increase the speed at which simulations run in order to better predict tactics that will lead to the podium.
Along with its innovative on-track initiatives, Oracle Red Bull Racing will continue to deliver an exceptional experience to its global fan base. Last season, Oracle and Red Bull Racing launched a first-of-its-kind fan loyalty platform powered by OCI—The Red Bull Racing Paddock—to bring the excitement of F1 to fans all over the world. Since The Paddock’s inception, Red Bull Racing has seen a more than 9x increase in member sign-ups. The new, direct line of communication between fans and the team has created outstanding engagement, with registered fans submitting thousands of questions to the team and redeeming 35,000 digital rewards. In 2022, Oracle Red Bull Racing will incorporate new features and capabilities, including the ability to create user-generated content, to bring an even deeper layer of personalization to fans.
“The presence of Oracle, one of the world’s largest cloud technology companies, as title partner not only signals huge confidence in Red Bull Racing’s ability to lead the technology race on track, it will also enable us to drive forward our ambitions for fan engagement, a core tenet of our marketing strategy,” said Oliver Hughes, chief marketing officer, Oracle Red Bull Racing. “We want to take fans with us on our competitive journey in F1, putting them right at the heart of the racing action and Oracle’s world class innovation and technology will help us achieve that goal.""
“Red Bull Racing has been more committed than any other F1 team in its use of technology to gain an edge, and it is paying off,” said Ariel Kelman, executive vice president and chief marketing officer, Oracle. “Our commitment to this partnership reflects our belief that OCI is a strategic weapon on race day, helps create the most exciting fan experience in sports, and can define the future of F1. Oracle Red Bull Racing is, and will continue to be, the most forward-thinking and innovative F1 team in the world.”  
  OCI Powers Engine Development, Driver Training, and Esports Team
Oracle is working with Red Bull Powertrains to develop the next generation of F1 engines set to debut in 2026 as Red Bull Racing becomes one of only four current manufacturers supplying engines for F1. Red Bull Powertrains will use OCI to optimize modeling of its new engine combustion chamber to reduce costs while improving results.
Red Bull Advanced Technologies and Oracle are also partnering to help develop the next generation of world-class drivers. Through projects applying AI and machine learning, Red Bull‘s junior drivers will better understand how data can inform and fine tune their driving style to reduce their lap times.
Oracle Red Bull Racing Esports marks the evolution of a partnership in one of the world’s fastest growing sporting industries, esports. Taking a cue from its real-world counterpart, the Team will use OCI-powered analytics to optimize car set up, improve race strategy, and provide its drivers with training that can help them consistently post ideal lap times on any virtual track, in any simulated weather.
The Formula 1 2022 season begins March 18-20 with the Gulf Air Bahrain Grand Prix in Bahrain.

SVP Worldwide taps Oracle Retail solutions to give shoppers and associates a high-value shopping experience
Austin, Texas and Nashville, TN—February 3, 2022
SVP Worldwide, the world’s largest consumer sewing machine provider is stitching together a better experience for customers with Oracle Retail. With consumers spending more time at home during the pandemic, SVP Worldwide saw a surge in sales for its household brand name sewing machines, SINGER®, HUSQVARNA VIKING®, and PFAFF®. To ensure consumers had a great experience when they returned to its 171 stores, SVP Worldwide upgraded to the latest Oracle Point of Service (POS) and Retail Customer Relationship Management (Retail CRM) systems. The upgrade was led by Oracle Retail Consulting (ORC).
“Our brand’s commitment is to inspire and delight our creative customers around the world,” said Kevin Blanchard, Chief Information Officer at SVP Worldwide. “By bringing agility to the customer experience, we can deliver a more fulfilling shopping experience in our stores. From an operational point of view, this project allows us to incorporate the needs of our store associates while lowering support and hardware costs.”

"Feb 1, 2022",Black History Month: An Opportunity to Look Forward,https://blogs.oracle.com/diversity-inclusion/post/black-history-month-traci-wade-look-forward,"Black History Month: an opportunity to look forward
Traci Wade | February 1, 2022 | 3 minute read
Black History Month is about the past and about the future.
Throughout February, we celebrate the Black experience in America and the many contributions of African Americans to this country’s economic, cultural, technological, and moral progress. We do this by renewing our focus on the past.
We do this because, as Dr. Carter G. Woodson, whose groundbreaking research and advocacy precipitated this celebration, emphasized throughout his life: denying a people’s history and tradition is a way of making them “a negligible factor in the thought of the world.”
Dr. Woodson’s great insight was that discovering, studying, and honoring history—a history that for too long had been intentionally suppressed—was a vital step toward the greater goal of social and economic advancement in all walks of American life.
Through my work leading diversity and inclusion efforts here at Oracle, I feel even more closely connected to Dr. Woodson’s legacy. That’s partly because Dr. Woodson for many years served as Dean at Howard University, one of eight Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) that Oracle is partnering with in several ways. These institutions educate about one-quarter of Black students who graduate with STEM degrees, and almost 30 percent of those in science and engineering doctorate programs started their educations at an HBCU.
Oracle executives sit on advisory councils at many HBCU institutions of higher learning, sharing with them insight and guidance as to curriculums that best prepare students to be highly competitive in the technology job market. We also mentor students and host leadership academies and guest lectures.
But Oracle’s support for many of those students starts even earlier—the first link in the chain of advancement is making sure kids from underrepresented and disadvantaged communities can afford to attend college. It’s through our 20-year partnership with the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) that we’re driving progress on this front.
Oracle has contributed more than $12 million to UNCF in scholarships and in-kind giving. And through this partnership, we offer two internship programs that bring African American students into different roles at Oracle, fund all their travel and housing, pay them competitive salaries, and then send them back to college with $10,000 scholarships.
Not all these talented young minds will opt for careers at Oracle once they graduate, but we try as best we can to be competitive in hiring them. At the same time, our larger recruitment efforts are geared toward attracting and hiring candidates from communities of color and other minority groups that have long had the deck stacked against them.
To that end, my D&I team closely collaborates with Oracle’s Talent Advisory Team to make sure Oracle’s comprehensive strategy looks to bring into our company the brightest minds from diverse backgrounds and cultures. That involves training recruiting staff, developing a broad pipeline of quality applicants, proper branding across our hiring portals, and implementing a model of shared accountability for meeting those goals. Our talent advisors work closely with my team to make sure there’s always a diverse pool of applicants in our hiring pipeline.
The final link in this chain of advancement is making sure that once we hire Black engineers, sales and marketing professionals, and business leaders, we ensure a welcoming and inclusive culture where everyone is enabled to achieve their professional potential and be promoted accordingly within the company.
I’m particularly proud of the Alliance of Black Leaders for Excellence (ABLE), an employee resource group created in the last year to help enrich the careers of Black employees at Oracle. There are now 15 ABLE chapters (and growing) that focus on developing Black employees for future leadership roles and partnering with the Oracle Talent Advisory Team on inclusive recruitment, retention, and community engagement. Oracle employees in this group help each other succeed and guide recent hires—some of them in their first job after graduating college—toward leadership roles down the road.
So as Black History Month honors the past, we hope we’re honoring Dr. Woodson’s vision of history showing us a brighter future by engaging at every step along the path of diversifying the tech industry, from helping promising young Black men and women afford college to preparing them while they’re here for success in tech to proactively recruiting talented graduates and then supporting their career advancement.

More Than 1,000 Global Organizations Migrate to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Using Oracle Cloud Lift Services
Ingersoll Rand, Volvo Group, Medica, Bangkok Commercial Asset Management, and Unimed Porto Alegre migrated complex workloads from on-premises to OCI with Oracle Cloud Lift Services
Oracle partners, including Accenture, Cognizant, Infosys, and Syntax leverage Oracle Cloud Lift Services to accelerate customer migration to OCI
Services enhanced to help customers with big data, data lakehouse, and data science design and migration
Austin, Texas—January 31, 2022
More than 1,000 global organizations are using Oracle Cloud Lift Services to accelerate the migration of mission-critical workloads to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Globally, customers and partners, including Ingersoll Rand, Volvo Group, Suramericana SA, National Pharmacies, Accenture, Cognizant, Infosys, and Syntax, continue to move enterprise and line of business applications, as well as complex integrations, from on-premises and other clouds to OCI. To support the growing demand and help more organizations take advantage of OCI, Oracle is enhancing the service offering with new capabilities that make it easier for customers to design and migrate their data lakehouse and AI-enabled application environments to OCI.
Launched in March 2021, Oracle Cloud Lift Services provide organizations with a single point of contact for end-to-end technical delivery, remove critical expertise barriers to adopting OCI services, speed time to value, and create faster opportunities to innovate. As part of the offering, organizations receive expert guidance from experienced cloud engineers on planning, architecting, prototyping, and managing cloud migrations—at no additional cost. As a result, customers can move critical workloads in weeks, or even days, instead of months. Additionally, Oracle works with customers until their workloads are in production and provides training on best practices, so customers have the expertise to run their environment independently or work with a “Day 2” managed service provider.
“As an increasing number of organizations look to move their most important enterprise workloads to the cloud, they have found that they want hands-on assistance to make their migrations as quick and seamless as possible,” said Vinay Kumar, senior vice president, North America Cloud Solutions Engineering, Oracle. “With Oracle Cloud Lift Services, customers can take advantage of Oracle’s experts to guide their migrations and get their critical workloads successfully running on OCI. This is the same technical team that has helped many of the world’s largest organizations manage some of the most complex migrations.”
“When it comes to cloud migration, not all migrations are the same and cloud providers must offer flexible services that match the customer’s needs,” said Dave McCarthy, research vice president, Cloud and Edge Infrastructure Services, IDC. “To yield the best results, this means more than a simple ‘lift and shift.’ Cloud providers must be willing to assist with everything from planning to go live, to ensure their customers are able to migrate in a fashion that’s timely, thorough, and ensures continuous uptime.”
The latest additions to Oracle Cloud Lift Services include capabilities to help customers design and migrate data lakehouse and AI-enabled application environments. To speed big data migrations, a new partnership with WANdisco, a leader in distributed computing, will enable organizations with vast production datasets to access WANdisco LiveData Migrator. WANdisco LiveData Migrator is a fully automated cloud migration solution that moves HDFS data and Hive metadata to the cloud without taking the data offline. The LiveData Migrator can deliver large data sets to the cloud up to 38 times faster than manual migration methods, saving customers time, money, and resources.
“Across the world, organizations are trying to figure out how to activate their large-scale on-premises data lakes in AI-enabled cloud environments to accelerate time to business insights and improve operational efficiencies,” said David Richards, founder and CEO, WANdisco. “By pairing with Oracle’s Cloud Lift Services offering, customers now have access to our LiveData Migrator, which uniquely allows them to automate the complete and continuous migration of their large business critical data lakes to OCI in record time without any risk of business interruption or downtime.”
  Oracle Cloud Lift Services Accelerate Migrations for Global Brands
Customers and partners worldwide from various industries including automotive, financial services, and healthcare, are utilizing Oracle Cloud Lift Services to help ensure successful migrations to the cloud.
  Ingersoll Rand
Ingersoll Rand is a global provider of mission-critical flow creation and industrial solutions.

Driven by an entrepreneurial spirit and ownership mindset, Ingersoll Rand is committed to helping make life better for employees, customers and communities with technology-driven products, services and solutions. To support their efforts, Ingersoll Rand leadership explored options for how best to run their Oracle E-Business Suite and related applications. After considering multiple options, partners and solutions, Ingersoll Rand chose Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Cloud Lift Services to run their applications because of OCI’s competitive pricing and proven performance.”
  Volvo Group
Headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden, Volvo Group drives prosperity through transport and infrastructure solutions, offering trucks, buses, construction equipment, power solutions for marine and industrial applications, financing and services that increase their customers’ uptime and productivity.

This has also helped iCE Consulting focus on ensuring our existing suite of technology integrates with the Oracle Cloud.”
  National Pharmacies
National Pharmacies is an Australian-based healthcare chain that prides itself on knowledgeable, empathic, and well-trained professionals across pharmacy, natural healthcare, optical, beauty, pet care, and other healthcare services.
“Our in-store tablets are a key part of providing our customers with the best customer relationship experience possible, which requires our pharmacists and staff to have the relevant information readily available at their fingertips,” said Ryan Klose, executive general manager, National Pharmacies. “As part of our ongoing modernization, we wanted to assure a high level of security, ‘always on’ resilience and functionality that is able to keep pace with the health records management running on these devices with zero disruption.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure offered us the performance and support we needed to get off the ground and into the cloud.”
  Expediter Services
A U.S. trucking-based service company, Expediter Services helps clients save money on associated costs ranging from fuel and financing to insurance.  
“With the help of the Oracle Cloud Lift Services team, Expediter Services used Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse, Oracle Data Integrator, and Oracle Analytics Cloud to not only increase the profitability of our Owner Operators, but also to drive costs down for our own fleet,” said Andrew Short, CIO, Expediter Services. “We’ve also been able to identify business trends quicker, which has allowed us to reduce the time and paperwork necessary for our financing decisions. Using Oracle APEX with our instance of Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse, we’ve been able to create a web application that is changing how we do business and opening up other revenue streams that will allow Expediter Services to continue to grow in the future.”
  Toda Corporation
Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, Toda Corporation is one of the premier global contractors, highly regarded for its medical facilities and school buildings, and committed to sustainability initiatives.
“As part of our strategic initiative to rebuild our mission-critical systems, Toda Corporation is moving our infrastructure to the cloud to take advantage of its benefits,” said Shigemi Mori, general manager, Infrastructure & Security Department, ICT Management Division, Toda Corporation. “With support from migration planning to PoC, Oracle Cloud Lift Services offers a complete path to migration without disruption, and allows us to drive cloud usage even further.”
  Unimed Porto Alegre
A leading medical healthcare cooperative in Brazil’s southern region, Unimed Porto Alegre assists nearly 700,000 customers.
“At Unimed Porto Alegre, we are always seeking to improve customer service, as well as optimize internal processes,” said Marcio Souza, cloud architect manager, Unimed Porto Alegre. “With Oracle Cloud Lift Services, we’ve been able to optimize and accelerate the entire migration process to the cloud and are forecasting 30 percent cost savings and a performance increase of up to three times our systems compared to the legacy environment. With Oracle, we are able to migrate mission-critical data to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in a safe way, increasing our performance and accelerating the data exploration process.”
  Partner Praise for Oracle Cloud Lift Services
The Oracle Cloud Lift Services offering provides a mutually beneficial relationship for professional services partners like Accenture, Cognizant, Infosys, and Syntax that are looking to give their customers a next-generation cloud infrastructure. OCI is designed to run every application—from enterprise systems of record to data lakes—with better performance, SLAs, and minimal modification. As a result, workloads can run on OCI as designed, which reduces the migration time to days or weeks rather than months and quarters.
By enabling an easy migration to OCI, Oracle Cloud Lift Services frees partners to focus on building customer relationships and value. That value increases once the migration is complete as partners can extend and integrate the migrated workloads and data into new applications, new analytics environments, or any other opportunities that benefit their customers. For customers, the offering translates to immediate cost savings and a smooth transition that leaves their entire budget intact.
“Accenture and Oracle have a long history of collaborating to help clients modernize their business operations,” said Phillip Hazen, global lead, Accenture Oracle Business Group. “Oracle’s Cloud Lift Services support our work together, helping to ensure clients’ migrations are successful and making for a more seamless transition to cloud.”
“Cognizant is a leading advisory, implementation, and managed service provider for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, having successfully completed more than 40 OCI projects worldwide,” said Suraj Jacob, global Oracle practice head, Cognizant. “Oracle’s full-service Cloud Lift Services coupled with our multi-pillar cloud implementation offering allows companies to modernize their back-office processes through a unified system that saves them time, money, and resources.”
“In combination with Infosys Cobalt cloud offerings, Oracle Cloud Lift Services help our customers accelerate outcome-driven cloud transformation programs,” said Dinesh Rao, EVP, and global head, Enterprise Application Services, Infosys. “Customers benefit from a rapid move to the cloud, with minimal impact to business and limited production downtime during production cutover.”
“Oracle Cloud Lift Services are the perfect complement to Syntax’s full-lifecycle, full-stack Oracle ERP services offerings,” said Marc Caruso, chief architect, Syntax. “Through the Oracle Cloud Lift Services offering, Oracle manages workload design and migration, then we run and enhance the customer’s mission-critical ERP workloads, improving availability and scalability while also leveraging the latest and greatest solutions in Oracle’s PaaS and SaaS portfolios. The combination of our two services enables organizations to seamlessly migrate to the cloud with minimal disruption and downtime and a flawless post go-live experience.”

Mayo Clinic selected Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications for enterprise resource planning, supply chain management and HR, as well as Oracle Fusion Analytics. With Oracle Cloud Applications, and the help of PwC as its Implementation Partner, Mayo Clinic will more easily gain a complete view of its organization’s finances, optimize financial planning and forecasting, simplify procurement and supply chain management, modernize human resources processes, and improve the employee experience. With Oracle’s prebuilt Analytics, Mayo Clinic will be able to more easily process relevant data, access actionable insights, and evaluate predictions to make timely business decisions.

Bally Takes a Step Forward in Customer Service with Oracle Retail
Iconic Swiss luxury fashion house giving stores a retail point-of-sale makeover to give customers a more personal omnichannel shopping experience
Ticino, Switzerland and Austin, Texas—January 26, 2022
Founded in 1851, Bally is one of the world’s longest-running luxury brands offering shoes, bags, accessories, and ready-to-wear fashion. While the brand evolves to reach multiple generations, it continues to focus on unmatched quality and customer service. To deliver on this promise, Bally is replacing its current Retail Point of Service (POS) systems with Oracle Retail Xstore across 18 countries. With the mobile Oracle systems, Bally associates will have easy access to the data they need to understand customer preferences better and move freely to help customers find the merchandise they are seeking—be it in-store or online—and check-out with ease.
“The boutiques are a real destination, where customers can enjoy a personalized shopping experience, interact with the sales staff, and feel the quality of the products first-hand,"" said Nicolas Girotto, CEO of Bally. “With the Oracle retail POS solutions, store associates will always be able to guide the customers throughout the shopping experience, offer first-class omnichannel services by combining physical and digital experiences, and process payments quickly.”
Accenture, a long-time Oracle PartnerNetwork (OPN) member with unparalleled capabilities in delivering complex, global transformations at-scale with Oracle technologies, will lead the strategic, multinational deployment and oversee the change management process.
Technology plays a key role in helping Bally align with customers' ever-changing preferences and deliver the service and experiences its customers expect. After reviewing multiple options in the market, Bally chose to replace its more than 500 POS systems with Oracle Retail Xstore Point-of-Service and Oracle Retail Xstore Office. Critical in this decision was the technology’s reputation in the market and unique reference library, which offers built-in processes and retail-specific best practices that will support a successful roll-out and ongoing support by Bally’s small IT team.
“When we embarked on the selection process, we were looking for a technology provider who could deliver against our vision and our reality of today. We believe Oracle can do both in the timeframe we need to support the business,” Girotto continued.
“As the consumer landscape continues to evolve, retailers need to manage the pace of change while keeping the customer at the core of their operations. At Oracle, we are focused on delivering a platform that delivers agility, scale, and operational excellence retailers need to do exactly that,” said Mike Webster, senior vice president, and general manager, Oracle Retail. “Our strategy is to build a platform that allows retailers like Bally to leverage our pre-built integration capabilities and common data model so they can focus on growing their business with Oracle.”

Syntax Taps Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as Strategic Platform for Multicloud Managed Services
Oracle’s next-generation cloud infrastructure will deliver superior price-performance, availability, and built-in security to Oracle and Syntax customers
Austin, Texas—January 25, 2022
Syntax, a leading provider of multicloud and mission-critical application managed services, has increased its investment in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) as part of its multicloud strategy and will accelerate the transformation of Oracle E-Business Suite to the cloud. As part of this partnership, Oracle and Syntax will jointly enable on-premises Oracle E-Business Suite customers to migrate or extend their solutions by taking advantage of OCI’s lower costs, better performance, improved scalability, and a wide array of platform services.
Under the newly announced partnership, Oracle and Syntax will jointly market and sell solutions and provide onboarding, migration, training, and customer success activities. The collaboration also positions Syntax to deliver increased value to customers by offering additional services and integrating Oracle’s PaaS technologies, such as Oracle Integration Cloud and Oracle Analytics Cloud.
Driven by the need to provide better price-performance, high availability, and built-in security, Syntax will offer OCI as a fully integrated, turnkey option to its existing private cloud customers. Syntax will also extend OCI’s services to its on-premises customers who have not yet realized the benefits of Oracle E-Business Suite in the cloud.
Organizations worldwide rely on Syntax to provide comprehensive technology solutions to meet their IT and enterprise resource planning needs. With more than 25 years of experience providing cloud and managed services for Oracle E-Business Suite applications, Syntax’s team of over 1,750 certified experts provide full-stack, full-lifecycle functional and technical services to organizations around the globe.

By moving Oracle E-Business Suite to OCI, customers can expect increased agility, improved productivity, and a decrease in the cost of ownership compared to on-premises deployments.
As part of the broader Oracle and Syntax strategic initiative to provide OCI for Oracle E-Business Suite customers, Syntax has rapidly integrated OCI into its existing suite of tools and automation, providing customers with more visibility, flexibility, and control of their Oracle E-Business Suite applications ecosystem. While customers benefit from the features and functionalities that Oracle E-Business Suite and OCI provide, this partnership also offers Oracle a trusted and validated partner in Syntax to successfully implement and manage the services.

New Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Services Authorized for the US Government
FedRAMP High JAB authorizations make additional OCI services available to US government organizations
Austin, Texas—January 24, 2022
Oracle achieved FedRAMP High Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) from the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) for an expanded set of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services. With authorizations for Oracle Autonomous Database, Oracle Integration Cloud, and others, government customers can improve their operations with a growing array of cost-effective, highly secure services available in Oracle’s US government regions.
“These newly authorized cloud services expand Oracle’s suite of differentiated, highly secure, high-performing technology for government customers,” said Rand Waldron, vice president, Global Government Sector, Oracle. “With these new tools, it will be even easier for government organizations to bring their most important systems to the cloud and take advantage of the unique efficiency, support and capability of Oracle to drive the success of their missions.”
The following OCI services are now covered by the FedRAMP High JAB P-ATO:
Oracle Autonomous Database on Dedicated Infrastructure enables customers to provision autonomous databases into their own dedicated Oracle Exadata cloud infrastructure. Oracle Autonomous Database runs natively on OCI while providing workload-optimized cloud services for transaction processing and data warehousing.
Oracle Autonomous Database on Shared Infrastructure allows multiple customers to share the resources of an Oracle Exadata cloud infrastructure. Customers can quickly get started with no minimum commitment, enjoying quick database provisioning, extensive automation of management tasks, and independent scalability of compute and storage.
Oracle Cloud Guard detects misconfigured resources and insecure activity across tenants and provides security administrators with the visibility resolve cloud security issues.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Catalog helps data professionals search, explore, and govern enterprise-wide data assets by automatically harvesting metadata across an organization’s data stores. This includes providing a common metastore across services such as Autonomous Database and OCI Object Storage.
Oracle Integration Cloud offers a combination of prebuilt connectivity to SaaS and on-premises applications, process automation templates, and an intuitive visual application builder for web and mobile application development.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging helps DevOps customers easily review log data, diagnose issues, and use the rules engine to trigger serverless Functions or alerts. VCN Flow Logs, a feature of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging, also gained authorization. The feature shows details about traffic that passes through customers’ virtual cloud network, helping organizations audit traffic and troubleshoot security lists.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Service Connector Hub provides a central place for describing, executing, and monitoring data movements between OCI services and from OCI to third-party services.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure OS Management allows customers to manage and monitor updates and patches for the operating system environments on Oracle Cloud instances.
Management Agent Cloud Service (MACS) manages the Management Agents and their lifecycle. Management Agents allow Oracle Cloud services to interact and collect data from entities that are managed by them.
This follows the authorization of more than three dozen OCI services in the past year, including OCI Compute Service, Oracle Digital Assistant, and Oracle Cloud VMWare Solution, as well as Oracle Cloud Marketplace. OCI delivers high-performance computing power that meets the needs of every type of enterprise application with scale-up architectures for agencies that want to adopt cloud technologies and easily migrate critical applications at their own pace. By simplifying management, scaling, and security with autonomous services such as Oracle Autonomous Database, OCI can reduce administrative costs by as much as 90 percent.
FedRAMP is the federal government program that sets the standard for assessing, authorizing, and monitoring cloud systems’ security. By attaining authorization from FedRAMP, Oracle’s government customers can be assured that Oracle’s cloud offerings have been thoroughly reviewed and approved by leading technology officials.
To attain these authorizations, Oracle utilized an accredited Third-Party Assessment Organization to complete a readiness assessment of the cloud service offerings for the authorization process. The service offerings were then reviewed by representatives from the FedRAMP’s Joint Advisory Board—comprised of technical reviewers from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DoD), and General Services Administration (GSA)—for FedRAMP High authorization.

NetSuite Cash 360 Helps Organizations Effectively Manage Cash Flow
New cash management solution includes configurable dashboard and automated cash flow forecasting capabilities that provide a real-time view of cash positions
Austin, Texas—January 19, 2022
To help businesses make more strategic cash decisions and improve forecasting, Oracle NetSuite today announced Oracle NetSuite Cash 360. Embedded within NetSuite, Cash 360 enables customers to effectively manage cash flow by providing a real-time view of their cash position and the ability to generate fast and accurate near-term forecasts. Cash 360 also simplifies cash management by providing a configurable dashboard that can include links to key cash management activities—displaying reminders of tasks that need to be taken care of, current cash balance, accounts payable and accounts receivable balances, cash flow trends, and a rolling six-month cash flow forecast.
“Insufficient cash flow is the main reason new businesses fail in the first five years, but despite it being such a critical area, many businesses struggle with cash management due to poor visibility and an inability to accurately forecast,” said Gary Wiessinger, SVP of product management, Oracle NetSuite. “NetSuite Cash 360 turns a complex process into a simple one by giving customers everything they need to effectively manage cash flow to help ensure they have the cash reserves to maintain day-to-day operations, pay employees and suppliers, fund sales and marketing efforts, service debt, acquire capital equipment, and make other long-term investments.”
Cash 360 is an automated solution embedded within NetSuite, improving forecast accuracy and saving finance departments time by directly accessing NetSuite data. With Cash 360, NetSuite customers can take advantage of a simplified and accelerated cash flow forecasting process to give them greater confidence in their financial decision making.
Cash Management: A new dashboard that can monitor receivables, payables, and available cash in real time to help customers improve cash flow visibility. Customers are able to review current cash flow trends and a rolling six-month cash flow forecast, to enable more informed decision making.
Cash Flow Forecasting: A new tool that helps customers develop more accurate forecasts by incorporating multiple datapoints—such as funding sources, planned expenditures, sales forecasts, and billing schedules—and applying historical averages to current AR and AP transaction data to estimate collections and disbursements. The configurable solution enables customers to incorporate one-time cash inflows and outflows, like financing or capital investments, into the forecasting process, allowing them to project their cash needs and evaluate their company’s liquidity position.
The combination of Oracle NetSuite Cash 360 with other NetSuite capabilities, such as billing automation, bank reconciliation, approval workflows, and budget validation, gives businesses added accounting efficiencies, greater control of cash inflows and outflows and more flexibility when making financial decisions.

NetSuite Project 360 Empowers Project Managers to Deliver Projects on Time and Within Budget
New dashboard within NetSuite SuiteProjects brings an additional layer of visibility and reporting enhancements
Austin, Texas—January 19, 2022
Oracle NetSuite today announced a new dashboard within NetSuite SuiteProjects to help services-based businesses efficiently manage projects for their clients. Oracle NetSuite Project 360 provides a centralized view of key metrics, reports, statuses, and resources, from across SuiteProjects to give project managers greater insight into vital project information. This helps project managers minimize administrative tasks and quickly identify projects needing attention and take the appropriate corrective action.
“One of the biggest challenges facing services businesses is lack of visibility into project status, budget, and forecast, which hinders project managers’ ability to easily gauge project health and act if needed,” said Gary Wiessinger, SVP of product management, Oracle NetSuite. “At NetSuite, we pride ourselves in delivering what we call ‘Suiteness’ for our customers, which is our unique ability to unify insights and actions across their entire business. Project 360 is a perfect example of this by providing customers with a unified view across projects, customers, employees, and financials, enabling project managers to be more proactive and take steps to keep projects on time and on budget.”
Project 360 enhances NetSuite SuiteProjects, which combines Customer Relationship Management (CRM), HR and accounting/Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), to provide customers with a comprehensive platform to run a services business. It can bring data from across SuiteProjects into a single dashboard, giving customers a centralized view into vital project information and enabling them to easily monitor KPIs. It can also decrease administrative time by giving project managers access to navigate to specific areas of the projects from one localized workspace. With Project 360, project managers can optimize:
Project Budget Analysis: Helps project managers understand if sufficient budget remains to complete a project by analyzing spend and allocation. In addition, Project Forecast Estimate at Completion (EAC) helps calculate if the project will be delivered within the original budget.
Project Billing: Helps project managers rectify and send invoices when necessary by enabling display of how much is currently billable to the client and what has yet to be billed.
Project Profitability: Helps project managers determine if a project is making the desired profitability based on recognized revenue and total costs to date.
Project Resourcing: Helps project managers understand the resources dedicated to a project by providing a “social view” (names and pictures) of the project team, a visualization of the project Gantt chart, and insights into how much time each resource has spent against the total for each assignment.
Project Health and Status: Helps project managers quickly and easily access specific information on project health and status including billing and revenue, budgets, resourcing and planning, and financials.
Client Information: Gives project managers an upfront synopsis of the client and surfaces client contact information and data.

Oracle Cloud Helps Schools Embrace the Next Era of Higher Education
Better use of data and more efficient operations enable higher education institutions to simplify business processes, maximize resources, and reduce costs
Austin, Texas—January 19, 2022
Colleges and universities continue to face a wave of change, from the adoption of remote learning and working to more distributed academic research models. To be able to quickly adapt in the face of adversity, leading higher education institutions are looking to Oracle Cloud. With Oracle Cloud for Higher Education, including Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications, and Oracle Student Cloud, schools including Bowie State University, Butler Community College, Coppin State University, Skidmore College, and University of Pittsburgh are simplifying business processes, maximizing resources, and better supporting their students and staff.
“Over the past year, higher education institutions have had to find new, creative ways to offer their services while staying focused on what matters most: the academic success and safety of students and faculty,” said Vivian Wong, group vice president of Higher Education Development, Oracle. “With Oracle, colleges of all sizes and disciplines can easily take advantage of the latest innovations in the cloud to drive efficiencies and make well-informed decisions.”
Bowie State University  
Founded in 1865, Bowie State University in Bowie, Maryland supports more than 6,000 students. Ninety-percent of Bowie’s first-year undergraduates receive financial aid, so it’s crucial that the process is as smooth as possible. When the university’s financial aid processes started to hinder the student experience and divert staff’s time, Bowie State decided to modernize the process with Oracle. With Oracle Student Financial Planning (SFP), part of Oracle Student Cloud, they will be able to eliminate inefficiencies for staff and empower students to secure available resources to ensure their success.
“We are dedicated to removing financial barriers that too often prevent students from pursuing or completing a degree, but our financial aid system wasn’t adequately contributing to that vision,” said Maurice Tyler, Vice President for Information Technology and CIO, Bowie State University. “Oracle Student Financial Planning will enable staff to focus on higher value work and spend more time engaging directly to promote access to aid and student success.”
Butler Community College
With eight campuses across South Central Kansas, Butler Community College serves 7,000 students. The college will move their Ellucian Banner system and other third-party applications to OCI to consolidate hardware, save time and money currently spent patching systems, and take advantage of enhanced security features.
Coppin State University
Since its inception in 1900, Baltimore-based Coppin State University (CSU) has had a clear mantra: students first. Today, the university serves thousands of students from diverse ethnic, religious, and socio-economic backgrounds. With Oracle Student Financial Planning, the university will be able to make the financial aid process easier and less uncertain for students.
“Our focus at Coppin is to transform our students’ experience,” said Ahmed El-Haggan, CIO and VP of Information Technology, Coppin State University. “With Oracle Student Financial Planning, we can offer our students an easier digital experience and increased visibility into their college financial planning. This will support them in making better informed decisions with improved outcomes, helping ensure they reach their educational goals.”
Skidmore College
Skidmore College, located in Saratoga Springs, New York, is among the top 50 liberal arts colleges in the U.S. The college implemented Oracle Cloud ERP and Oracle Cloud HCM to create an automated and unified back-office experience. With the applications, Skidmore College will be able to eliminate manual processes, reduce costs associated with maintaining legacy systems, and improve the productivity and performance of its finance and HR functions.
“The past year has magnified the need to be agile to support changing business models and initiatives,” said Dwane Sterling, chief technology officer, Skidmore College. “With Oracle, we’re creating a genuinely automated back-office experience that connects the dots between departments, enabling us to become more responsive, and financially and operationally efficient.”
University of Pittsburgh
The University of Pittsburgh, one of the nation’s top public institutions for higher education and research, has implemented Oracle Cloud HCM to provide a better experience for staff and faculty. With Oracle Cloud HCM, University of Pittsburgh employees can complete HR tasks more efficiently and with greater accuracy. For example, the university’s administrative users can log in to the online HR portal, see the status of a request and where it is in the approval cycle to identify delays and quickly address issues. The university can also benefit from improved employee visibility with enhanced workforce analytics.
“As a leading research university, it’s crucial for us to constantly innovate and stay ahead in the industry. Our people are the essential link in ensuring that happens,” said Michelle Fullem, acting assistant vice chancellor, HR operations, University of Pittsburgh. “Our previous on-premises HR systems weren’t built to keep pace with the speed of change we’re seeing today. Adopting Oracle Cloud HCM allows us to take immediate advantage of the latest tech enhancements to continually improve efficiencies in our HR processes while providing a great experience to our staff.”

  Oracle Cloud Applications for Education
Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications Suite offers a fully integrated suite of cloud applications to run every part of a university including Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Performance Management (EPM), Oracle Fusion Cloud Supply Chain Management & Manufacturing (SCM), Oracle Fusion Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM), and Oracle Fusion Cloud Advertising & Customer Experience (CX).

New cloud region in Johannesburg delivers superior performance, built-in security, and high availability
Oracle now has 37 cloud regions globally and plans to open an additional seven cloud regions by the end of 2022
Johannesburg, South Africa—January 19, 2022
Oracle today announced the availability of its first cloud region in Africa to meet the rapidly growing demand for enterprise cloud services on the continent. The Oracle Cloud Johannesburg Region will boost cloud adoption across Africa while also helping businesses achieve better performance and drive continuous innovation. The opening marks Oracle’s 37th cloud region worldwide with plans to have at least 44 cloud regions by the end of 2022, continuing one of the fastest expansions of any major cloud provider.
“The fourth industrial revolution, which is powered by cloud-led technologies, has significantly accelerated in South Africa and the wider African continent. In recent months, cloud technologies have played a vital role in helping African public and private sector organisations ensure business continuity, deliver essential services, and meet evolving customer expectations. The Oracle Johannesburg region offers a next-generation cloud to run any application faster and more securely for less, helping businesses build resilience, agility and achieve improved ROI,” said Richard Smith, executive vice president, EMEA, Oracle.
The Johannesburg region is built on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which enables customers to easily migrate IT workloads and data platforms to the cloud or build new cloud native applications. In addition, Oracle offers a wide range of application modernisation and cloud strategies to help African organisations operate with global competitiveness.
  Customer, Analyst, and Partner Commentary
African organisations are using Oracle to manage their mission-critical workloads and take advantage of cloud economics. Customers will benefit from significant performance improvements and reduced operational costs.
Airports Company South Africa owns and manages a network of nine airports in South Africa, including the three main international gateways: O.R. Tambo International, Cape Town International and King Shaka International, which together process more than 40 million passengers annually.
“Airports Company South Africa is mandated to advance South Africa’s national agenda of economic growth and development while delivering a sustainable and profitable business. Cloud-led digital transformation is vital for us to maintain an agile and profitable business model. The Oracle Cloud Johannesburg Region will offer us the flexibility to explore the latest technologies that can support our digital roadmap,” said Mthoko Mncwabe, CIO, Airports Company South Africa.
The Government Pensions Administrative Agency (GPAA) ensures the effective, transparent and accountable administration of pension funds on behalf of the Government Employees Pension Fund (GPEF) and the National Treasury of South Africa.
“GPAA is in the process of replacing legacy applications and refreshing its IT infrastructure. The timing of the Johannesburg region opening is perfect to enable us to lift and shift our existing and future Oracle deployments to the cloud. This will enable us to cut down on on-premises infrastructure and assist with the management of Oracle services, cybersecurity and disaster recovery,” said Meiring Coetzee, CIO, Government Pensions Administrative Agency.
Telkom is Africa’s largest telecommunications company.
“Telkom plays a leading role in South Africa’s digital revolution, providing the latest converged ICT solutions for a range of business and residential customers. The Johannesburg region will boost the local infrastructure capability of South Africa and the wider continent, and help organisations kick-start their digital transformation journeys,” said Reubin Layman, CIO, Openserve, Telkom SA.
“Our deep partnership with Oracle has always been one of Accenture’s most strategic and important initiatives to help our clients leverage the cloud and thrive in a cloud-first world. In this era of rapid transformation, cloud has proven to be a powerful tool for organisations to master change—in fact, we have found that cloud-focused organisations in Africa and Asia Pacific were able to achieve 1.5 times more cost reduction and were reported to be 3.7 times more likely to innovate as compared to their competitors. We have seen the benefits Oracle Cloud Infrastructure brings to our clients and know that the Oracle Cloud Johannesburg Region will further accelerate organisations’ cloud adoption and their ability to become agile, intelligent and digital businesses,” said Kgomotso Lebele, Technology Lead, Accenture Africa.
“Public cloud services adoption is accelerating at CAGR of 25 percent year on year between 2020 and 2025 in Sub-Saharan Africa and IDC projects that the growth momentum will continue. The role of cloud in enabling innovation is underscored by the priority organisations have given to it as part of their digital transformation initiatives. Cloud-based technologies have helped organisations weather the COVID-19 crisis and cloud is now helping them build resilient organisations that can withstand uncertainties. Our survey of CIOs in South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria highlights that an in-country data center is an important factor for 60 percent of organisations that are planning to adopt cloud over the next 12-18 months. The Johannesburg region will boost regional cloud infrastructure availability. IDC believes that cloud has become an inseparable element of an organisation’s digital transformation and innovation roadmap,” said Mark Walker, associate vice president, Sub-Saharan Africa, IDC.
“Supply chain is mission critical. Kӧrber’s unrivaled portfolio of supply chain software, spanning WMS, voice, robotics and beyond, empowers businesses to turn what were once warehousing and logistics challenges into strategic differentiators. Our work with Oracle takes this to another level, enhancing our capabilities with the power of the cloud. We look forward to the possibilities our solutions and the Oracle Cloud together will bring the industry in South and Sub Saharan Africa and globally”, said Joe Couto, executive vice president, robotics and 3PL at Kӧrber Supply Chain Software.
  Preparing Africa’s Next Generation for the Digital Economy
In South Africa, Oracle has initiated an annual “Graduate Leadership Program” to address the skills gap in the local ICT industry and creating employment opportunities for South Africa’s youth. The program focuses on equipping disadvantaged South African students with specialised technology and leadership skills that prepare them for a career in the IT industry. Since its inception in 2014, more than 200 graduates have completed this program with several securing permanent employment with Oracle partner companies and other organisations.
  High Availability and Disaster Protection
Oracle’s strategy is to meet customers where they are, enabling customers to keep data and services where they need it. Customers can deploy Oracle Cloud completely within their own data centers with Dedicated Region and Exadata Cloud@Customer, deploy cloud services locally with public cloud-based management, or deploy cloud services remotely on the edge with Roving Edge Infrastructure.
OCI’s next-generation architecture provides a high-performing, resilient foundation for cloud services, while its physical and virtual network design maximizes performance and security. For example, each Oracle Cloud region contains at least three fault domains, which are groupings of hardware that form logical data centers for high availability and resilience to hardware and network failures.
  Sustainability
Oracle is committed to sustainability and has pledged to power all Oracle Cloud regions worldwide with 100 percent renewable energy by 2025. Several Oracle Cloud regions in North America, South America, and Europe are already powered by 100 percent renewable energy, and all Oracle Cloud regions use state-of-the-art energy management and cooling technologies to minimize their impact on the environment.  As part of its clean Cloud initiative, Oracle reused or recycled 99.6 percent of its retired hardware in FY21 while strictly adhering to Oracle’s data privacy and security practices.
  Cloud Regions Deliver All Cloud Services and Multicloud
Oracle Cloud regions support every Oracle service and feature and are available to customers anywhere in the world. This includes Oracle Autonomous Database, Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes, Oracle Cloud VMware solution, and Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications Suite.
OCI’s extensive network of more than 70 FastConnect global and regional partners offer customers dedicated connectivity to Oracle Cloud regions and OCI services—providing customers with the best options anywhere in the world. FastConnect provides an easy, elastic, and economical way to create a dedicated and private network connection with higher bandwidth, lower latency, and more consistent performance versus public Internet-based connections. Partners available at launch for the Oracle Cloud Johannesburg Region include Colt, Telia, Equinix, and Megaport.
In addition, OCI and Microsoft Azure have a strategic partnership that enables joint customers to run workloads across the two clouds. This partnership provides a low latency, cross-cloud interconnect between OCI and Azure in ten regions (San Jose, Phoenix, Ashburn, Toronto, Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Tokyo, South Korea and Vinhedo), federated identity for joint customers to deploy applications across both clouds, and a collaborative support model. Customers can run full stack applications in a multi-cloud configuration, while maintaining high-performance connectivity without requiring re-architecture. They can also potentially migrate existing applications or develop cloud native applications that use a mix of OCI and Azure services.
  Oracle Cloud’s Expanding Global Footprint
As part of Oracle’s planned expansion of its cloud region footprint to support strong customer demand for Oracle Cloud services worldwide, over the next year, Oracle will open seven additional cloud regions in Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, France, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.

Austin, Texas—January 18, 2022
Oracle today announced that Xerox, a company continually redefining the workplace experience, selected Oracle Cloud to support the launch of new businesses aiming to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems at massive scale. With Oracle Cloud solutions, Xerox is bringing new technologies to market focused on 3D printing for manufacturing, structural health monitoring for critical infrastructure, and augmented reality to improve customer support.
Xerox has been a leader in office and production print technology for more than 100 years. As part of its strategy to address pressing societal issues, Xerox decided to expand its business portfolio by creating new and innovative businesses based on disruptive technologies. However, with its existing IT technology, Xerox had to spend more time than desired to implement the systems needed to support a new business.
“Our vision is to launch breakaway businesses powered by breakthrough technologies as quickly as possible so that we can work to solve these problems facing our planet and society. In order to do that, we needed a unified cloud platform across the entire business,” said Naresh Shanker, senior vice president and chief technology officer, Xerox. “With Oracle Cloud and Oracle NetSuite, we have the underlying foundation in place, which will allow us to operate with agility and speed. We’re now able to quickly launch business models and processes on a single platform with no integration required.”
With Oracle Cloud and NetSuite, Xerox’s businesses can sell online, create orders, process invoices, track performance, execute financial planning, and send and receive data – without any involvement needed from the IT department. Armed with these Oracle solutions, the new Xerox businesses will be positioned to deliver much-needed capabilities, including industrial IoT to monitor critical infrastructure, 3D printing for manufacturing, and augmented reality for customer support.
“For more than a century, Xerox has been at the forefront of business technology innovation,” said Jonathan Tikochinsky, executive vice president, strategic clients group, Oracle. “We’re proud to partner with the company as it applies that same dedication and expertise to solving pressing global issues.”
Xerox has worked with Deloitte and Infosys to implement a wide range of Oracle Cloud services to fast-track the launch of its innovation businesses and enable them to quickly monetize services. This includes Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) for budgeting and financial planning, NetSuite for finance and accounting, Oracle Commerce for an online storefront, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) for a complete cloud infrastructure platform. In addition to enabling integration in every direction via Oracle Integration, OCI provides Xerox and new businesses with access to a set of data management services built on self-driving Oracle Autonomous Database technology, delivering advanced analytics and automated patching, upgrades, and tuning. Xerox can also tap the power of OCI High Performance Computing when researching potential new businesses, and under OCI’s Universal Credits purchasing option, Xerox can mix-and-match any OCI services.

Austin, Texas and Park City, Utah—January 18, 2022
Backcountry, the specialty retailer of premium outdoor gear and apparel, is expanding its store footprint with Oracle. After 25 years as an online-only retailer, Backcountry opened two brick-and-mortar stores in 2021 with plans to quickly expand across the US. Each store doubles as a shopping destination and gathering space for the outdoor community to get together. Using Oracle Retail Xstore Point-of-Service, retail associates can better help shoppers anywhere their in-store adventure takes them.
“Our mission is to get people outside and to connect them to their passions. Forming friendships and sharing adventures with fellow outdoor enthusiasts in our stores was a natural progression of our brand DNA,” says Chris Purkey, senior vice president of retail at Backcountry. “Oracle Retail will provide the scalability we need to support our growing business, wide assortment of inventory, and extensive services. With the new mobile systems, our associates will be able to deliver a personal touch only our team can offer.”
Backcountry is replacing its homegrown point-of-sale system with Oracle Retail Xstore Point-of-Service at its three stores in Utah and Colorado, starting Q2 2022. The roll-out will carry over into future store openings as Backcountry continues to expand its brick-and-mortar footprint. By adopting Xstore, Backcountry’s unrivaled customer service team of outdoor experts, known as “Gearheads,” will gain the flexibility to move about the store and guide customers through its expansive product assortment. In addition, Gearheads will have inventory and customer information in the palm of their hands to provide better, faster service.
“Backcountry shoppers are adventure seekers, and the brand is dedicated to supporting them both inside and outside the store,” says Mike Webster, senior vice president and general manager of Oracle Retail. “With Xstore, the Backcountry team will be able to freely move to provide that personalized insight and advice the brand is revered for. As Backcountry’s evolves, the Xstore platform will keep pace by quickly accommodating new features, from buy online pickup in-store (BOPIS) to a highly engaged endless aisle experience.”

Qatar Airways Gains Business Advantage in Moving Financial Planning to Oracle Cloud
One of the world’s fastest-growing airlines implements Oracle Cloud EPM to increase agility, improve insights and enhance business decision-making
DOHA, Qatar—January 12, 2022
Oracle has announced that Qatar Airways has implemented Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) as the multiple award-winning airline transitions through the pandemic and embarks on a major global expansion. With Oracle Cloud EPM, Qatar Airways financial teams gain the transparency and flexibility needed for more accurate planning, budgeting, and forecasting. The improved processes are helping the airline increase agility, improve insights and enhance business decision-making across the organisation.
As one of the world’s fastest-growing airlines Qatar Airways serves over 140 destinations, operating a fleet of more than 200 aircraft from its global hub at Hamad International Airport in Doha, and employing more than 40,000 people. As the airline embarked on a major global expansion in the last decade, its existing systems and manual processes could not scale to keep pace with the company’s growth. The airline needed to automate and streamline its financial and planning processes to more effectively control and manage resources and investments, improve reporting capabilities, and align the organisation behind its ambitious expansion plans. As the commercial aviation sector recovers from the pandemic in the second half of 2021, Qatar Airways is quickly returning to its pre-pandemic network of 180 destinations and resuming its expansion program.
“While the pandemic had a significant impact on the aviation sector, the ability of Qatar Airways to remain resilient and reliable for its customers, and respond quickly to these unforeseen challenges, has been critical to maintaining our business competitiveness. The foundation we have built with Oracle Cloud EPM for our financial processes has enabled us to adapt quickly, especially as we plan for the transition out of the pandemic and the resumption of our growth plans. We have been able to model scenarios to increase efficiency, reduce risk, and provide our leaders with the correct information to allow them to make informed decisions,” said Daniel Ho, Chief Financial Officer, Qatar Airways.
Oracle Cloud EPM enables Qatar Airways to better connect operational and financial data across HR, finance, supply chain and sales to improve management insights, accelerate decision-making, and enhance the company’s business modelling and planning. Moving business processes to Oracle Cloud EPM has also enabled the company to eliminate manual processes in financial reporting to improve the speed, accuracy and insights of reports.
“The airline sector is facing a unique challenge as it navigates recent disruptions and rapidly changing recovery,” said Leopoldo Boado Lama, Senior Vice President, Business Applications, ECEMEA, Oracle. “With Oracle Cloud EPM, Qatar Airways will gain a competitive edge by always having access to the latest innovations and emerging technologies. With Oracle, Qatar Airways will be able to gain real-time business insights and accurately forecast revenues to make better business decisions in a dynamic market. While highly relevant in the current business context, these capabilities will also improve productivity and ensure the airline can respond to future challenges in what is a continually evolving business environment.”
Oracle Consulting is the implementation partner for this initiative.

Introducing Oracle Cloud for Telcos - Redefining the Telco Cloud Market
Clay Magouyrk | January 11, 2022 | 9 minute read
Executive Vice President, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Engineering
Operating complex networks to serve millions of subscribers is a constant challenge. From day-to-day operations and expansion to new technology and standards, the telco world is about reinventing yourself every day. Telcos need to constantly strive for greater efficiencies, reduced costs, new sources of revenue, and new ways to provide customers with the best possible experience.
But it’s also about data – and lots of it. Voice is a commodity and data is king. Customers are growing ever more distributed and data-rich with 5G, mobile, and IoT. Global businesses are increasingly making product and service decisions regionally, locally, and often, exactly where the customer happens to be. Governments and citizens want to keep their data and applications in-country and within sovereign borders. To support the changing landscape around data, you need to derive insight from it, secure it, get closer to it, and offer new services for consumers and enterprises. Telcos have to digitally transform to enable higher impact business outcomes, deliver insight driven “digital” ecosystems and execute agile business models with flexibility.
Telecommunications is in Oracle’s DNA. With decades of experience working with global telcos to support their critical data systems, applications, and network operations, we understand the journey you’re on. We know the challenges of distributed workloads, regional and industry compliance, big data, and hyperscale environments. We believe that together, we can provide an exceptional customer experience and drive new opportunities for growth. We've already started with key partners like TIM (Telecom Italia), Bharti Airtel, and Telefonica Espana.
We are excited to announce Oracle Cloud for Telcos.
Oracle Cloud for Telcos is a comprehensive set of cloud solutions built on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). OCI is a cloud platform available around the world in 36 public cloud regions, as well as in a distributed cloud architecture. The OCI platform runs Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications Suite, Oracle Communications core network and B/OSS solutions, and more than 60 other industry application suites, as well as third-party and custom applications and workloads. It enables telcos to build new applications or modernize existing workloads with 80 plus cloud services, including data management, developer services, analytics, and artificial intelligence.
  Oracle Cloud for Telcos enables any telecommunications provider to become more agile, reduce capital expenditures and operating costs, and establish a flexible foundation for innovation. Telcos can:
Modernize their Enterprise IT and OSS/BSS in the cloud, improving performance by more than 50 percent and reducing costs by as much as 60 percent
Gain insights across all Telco IT, network, and edge data for greater efficiency and new revenue
Run their core and edge networks as cloud-native services, reducing CAPEX and increasing agility
Run their IT, network, and new services on a distributed cloud architecture, combining OCI's innovative hybrid cloud technologies with the Telco's broad customer reach
Generate net new revenue streams by creating and/or serving next generation applications
Let's walk through the five solutions in more detail.
Run any IT and OSS/BSS application 50 percent faster, for less
Oracle Cloud for Telcos has key innovations that make it easy to migrate and run the most critical IT and OSS/BSS applications, including Oracle, third-party, or custom applications. Oracle Cloud provides the database clustering and massive I/O necessary to maintain near zero downtime environments while improving performance 50 percent or more over on-premises or other clouds. We have proven scale, as recently demonstrated by benchmarking Oracle's Cloud Scale Charging to 100 million subscribers. Oracle also offers Monetization, Orchestration, and Customer Experience in nearly all our public cloud locations. Our interconnection partnership with Microsoft Azure enables our customers to run workloads across the two clouds with federated identity and only 2 millisecond latency, offering even more flexibility. Whether you're migrating existing apps, converting to SaaS, or require a multicloud or hybrid architecture, Oracle Cloud for Telcos can help, with the most competitive pricing in the cloud.
TIM Brasil, a large Brazilian mobile provider, had a goal to improve their customer support and dramatically reduce their carbon emissions by moving 100 percent of their workloads to the cloud. They chose Oracle Cloud for Telcos and Microsoft Azure for a multicloud strategy. TIM Brasil is moving their core billing and operational systems, including third-party, custom, and Oracle applications, as well as a 4,000 server VMware environment hosting hundreds of other applications, to Oracle Cloud.
Transform customer experience and operations with data and AI
Many telco customers already have their customer records and transactions in Oracle Databases and Oracle Applications. Oracle Cloud for Telcos makes it easy to integrate this data, or data from nearly any source, with less structured data like IoT, images, logs, and more in a cloud data lakehouse. From there, data can be processed by cloud data services like Apache Spark (OCI Data Flow), Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse or MySQL Heatwave, optimized by services like Data Science or an AI service like OCI Language (text processing), and visualized by Oracle Analytics or third-party analytics. All this technology is available on demand to help you understand customer and operational patterns and gain valuable insights to reduce customer churn, predict network congestion, or provide preventative maintenance.
Safaricom, the largest Kenyan telco, had significant overhead in their outsourcing process, costing them millions of dollars. They used Oracle Cloud for Telcos to integrate data from their Oracle Fusion Supply Chain Management and other sources into Autonomous Data Warehouse. Oracle Analytics, with its built-in machine learning, helped Safaricom identify patterns to improve supplier negotiations and accelerate tender contract renewals.
Efficiently operate, control, and differentiate network services
Oracle Cloud for Telcos offers Oracle Communications' best-in-class cloud native 5G core solutions across policy and charging, signaling and routing and networks analytics and automation. These cloud-native services can be run on many core or edge environments and they can interoperate with other third-party core network functions on the Oracle Cloud. Oracle Communications Session Border Controller (SBC) on Oracle Cloud is the ideal choice for telcos as they evolve their networks toward 5G and cloud. It helps operators deliver trusted, carrier-grade, real-time communications for the next generation of consumer and enterprise applications.
Our public cloud is already in 36 locations around the world – with a plan for 44 by the end of 2022 – the fastest expansion of any hyperscale cloud provider. This means low latency access for more customers and more data that is retained in specific countries. High speed access to the regions is available publicly or privately through over 50 network providers, at 1/4 the cost of other cloud providers. Within cloud regions, we offer consistent low latency – less than 100μs one-way latency between hosts and less than 500μs between Availability Domains – with a highly flexible range of runtime environments for maximum utilization and horizontal and vertical scaling. This includes bare metal, burstable and flexible VMs, Kubernetes managed containers, and functions as a service. We also offer Oracle Cloud VMware Solution (OCVS), which allows you to create and manage VMware enabled software-defined data centers (SDDCs) in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
BT, the largest provider of mobile and broadband in the UK, selected Oracle for its overall 5G readiness, product maturity, and competitive strengths. BT is leveraging Oracle’s cloud native 5G core solution. This includes Oracle Communications Cloud Native Converged Policy Management to optimize its network resources and being new 5G offerings to market.
Run IT, network, and edge services on a distributed cloud architecture
Acquiring cloud service capabilities has been relatively straight-forward for telcos.  If they want a service, they would either have to stand it up themselves on their own hardware (e.g., Red Hat OpenShift), or they would be tethered to a public cloud for the service (e.g., AWS Outposts). Oracle Cloud for Telcos redefines the market. In addition to our public cloud regions, we offer entire cloud stacks – inclusive of hardware, scaling, refresh, patches, and upgrades – in an OPEX model. Our Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer offers all 80 plus OCI services, including future services, in this model. Additionally, the cloud control plane resides with the customer. Dedicated Regions are not tethered to our public cloud and all data and metadata stays within a telco customer's environment for the highest degree of control in the market. Dedicated Regions can meet the needs of core or regional data centers in a brand new way.
Oracle Cloud for Telcos also offers additional form factors, which can support near and far edge deployments. Exadata Cloud@Customer offers the highest performance Oracle Databases as a service that customers can deploy anywhere. We also offer rack scale compute and storage with Private Cloud Appliances, and Roving Edge Infrastructure enables remote deployment of compute and storage services as single nodes or clusters of up to 15 nodes. The combination of these offerings provides telcos with a very flexible distributed cloud capable of running a wide range of operational workloads: from Enterprise IT and OSS/BSS to 4G/5G network functions to edge services such as video analytics, and ML inferencing. The distributed cloud promises to provide end-to-end policy and control over applications and infrastructure from core to edge.
Entel, the largest Chilean telco, had a goal to shut down all their IT data centers. They were able to meet that goal with Oracle Cloud for Telcos. They moved the bulk of their OSS/BSS and enterprise applications, including Oracle and third-party applications, to OCI public cloud regions in Chile and Brazil, saving 50 percent compared to their own data centers and dramatically improving customer support. They moved most of their databases to Exadata Cloud@Customer, improving performance 300 percent and shifting database management to Oracle.
Create and serve next-generation applications
Our fifth solution area enables telcos to take advantage of new revenue generating opportunities created by 5G and other network innovations. Oracle Cloud for Telcos provides developer-friendly infrastructure and services so enterprise customers and ISV partners can more easily build, deploy and manage next generation applications that need to leverage the telco network. With core, near edge, and far edge presence, and developer services like CI/CD, source code management, ML model creation, training, and management, pre-built AI services for analyzing text, speech, images, and anomalies, and container, function, and API deployment and management, telcos have everything they need to enhance their application development and hosting capabilities. This powerful combination of Oracle's developer services and the telco's ""everywhere"" presence provides the agile environment to host and scale today’s applications while futureproofing for applications that we haven't even imagined.
Get started with Oracle Cloud for Telcos
Of course, each of these powerful telco solutions are backed by Oracle Cloud's strong SLAs, available through our flexible Universal Credits plan, and supported through our no cost Oracle Cloud Lift program. Cloud Lift provides Oracle experts to help you architect, migrate, and run your workloads on Oracle Cloud, as well as get your staff and system integrators trained and ready for go-live.
We're excited to announce Oracle Cloud for Telcos, to provide operators the ability to gain operational efficiencies, create better customer experiences and take advantage of new revenue generating opportunities. We look forward to expanding our partnership with the world's leading communications companies.

Oracle Scales Up Converged Charging to Serve 100 Million Subscribers
Multi-site deployment validates geographical scale and real-time charging efficiency of Oracle Cloud Scale Charging on OCI
Austin, Texas—January 11, 2022
With nearly 200 commercial 5G deployments, communications service providers (CSPs) will need to monetize new offers ranging from cloud gaming to smart construction and IoT. The success of these new use cases and their underlying business models will hinge on efficiently scaling charging operations to support tens or even hundreds of millions of subscribers.
To ensure CSPs can meet these demands, Oracle recently put its Cloud Scale Charging to the test. Running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) using Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE), the solution achieved single-digit millisecond latency in a multi-site performance test scaled to support 100 million concurrently active subscribers. Achieving 270,000 transactions per second, the test showed that Oracle’s cloud native solutions can meet even the most strenuous charging requirements of the world’s largest CSPs. 
“CSPs will need to charge for 5G services in real-time using hyperscale performance, scalability, and availability,” said John Abraham, principal analyst, Analysys Mason. “Cloud native architectures will also be essential to helping CSPs reduce cost and improve time to cash across the revenue lifecycle. Oracle’s performance test results show Cloud Scale Charging is equipped to meet these stringent performance requirements.”
Cloud Scale Charging is an online and offline charging solution within Oracle’s Cloud Scale Monetization portfolio. A rebranding of Oracle Communications Billing and Revenue Management (BRM) and affiliated products, Oracle’s Cloud Scale Monetization portfolio of charging, billing, and revenue management solutions, including Cloud Scale Charging, Cloud Scale Billing, and Cloud Scale Charging and Billing, enables CSPs to support any service, payment, or business model across 2G-5G mobile networks.
“The results show that with Oracle’s Cloud Scale Charging, CSPs don’t have to limit innovation. The solution’s rating and balance management capabilities are unhindered by the complexity of the pricing model or account structure and enable CSPs to maintain scalability and business continuity without compromising performance,” said Jason Rutherford, senior vice president and general manager, Oracle Communications, Applications. “Oracle’s Cloud Scale Monetization portfolio brings together the company’s deep expertise in the communications industry with a breadth of capabilities for developing high-performance cloud native solutions.”
  Sustained performance in a multi-site deployment
The performance test setup included deployment of the cloud-agnostic Cloud Scale Charging solution on OCI. The OCI environment provides unmatched price-to-performance ratios, the ease of deploying with OKE, and industry-leading security which is critical for meeting the demands of telco workloads. Industry-realistic traffic patterns and charging scenarios were used for the test, including an account mix of 90% prepaid and 10% postpaid for the 100 million accounts provisioned.
To demonstrate the power of Cloud Scale Charging’s in-memory charging grid with bi-directional data federation powered by Oracle Coherence, traffic was distributed and charging updates federated across two of Oracle Cloud’s 36 regions – Phoenix in the western U.S. and Ashburn on the East Coast of the U.S. Performance results measured over 270,000 transactions per second across the two sites, encompassing voice, messaging, data charging traffic along with inbound balance queries, and outbound notifications. In addition, single-digit millisecond latency was observed across all charging traffic types and 20,700 rated events per second were generated at each site for consumption in downstream systems (e.g., billing or customer engagement systems).
The test also reaffirmed the efficacy of Cloud Scale Charging’s cloud native architecture, with efficient resource utilization observed for application and database CPU and memory at each site in a single and multi-site test. Meeting the performance requirements of 5G is a key driver of CSP investment in a new converged charging system, according to a recent Oracle survey.

Helbiz Kitchen Boosts Ghost Kitchen Global Growth with Oracle Cloud
Austin, Texas—January 11, 2022
Helbiz, (NASDAQ: HLBZ) a global leader in micro-mobility also runs one of the world’s largest ghost kitchens. Its 21,500 square foot Helbiz Kitchen brings together the best dishes from across Milan—from burgers to ice cream—by licensing from popular brands and preparing multiple cuisines in one location.
To help ensure that all orders get processed correctly and out for customer delivery quickly, Helbiz turned to Oracle MICROS Simphony Point of Sale. With integrated inventory management, the brand is able to avoid out-of-stock items, while also delivering on its sustainability and waste reduction goals. With the success of its Italian operations, Helbiz Kitchen is expanding into the US in 2022.
Ghost kitchens are commercial kitchens built to prepare food for delivery or takeout only, without a storefront or wait staff. Their popularity is booming among restaurants and brands wanting to build mobile ordering and food delivery businesses.
“As we continue to expand Helbiz Kitchen not only in Italy, but also in other countries, in the United States and new locations across Europe, we need a cloud solution that can easily integrate with our mobile app and loyalty solutions at scale,” said Paolo Scocco, COO of Helbiz Kitchen. “The Oracle platform is the central hub from which all business systems are informed. With embedded analytics, our transaction data will refine day-to-day decision-making and long-term business strategies.”
Helbiz Kitchen strategically invests in ambitious concepts that are both technologically sound and support its environmental, social and governance (ESG) conscious goals. Even as menus and offerings are constantly changing, mobile application orders are routed smoothly through Simphony to Oracle MICROS Kitchen Display Systems, helping ensure they’re queued fast, accurately, and prepped based on the promised delivery time. By centralizing all order transaction data on a single platform coupled with embedded restaurant analytics and reporting, Helbiz Kitchen gets real-time updates on its revenue by concept, inventory, and labor costs.
“The surge in online and app-based ordering has sped the adoption of ghost kitchens as a means to efficiently serve consumers looking to discover and enjoy a large spectrum of cuisines,” said Simon de Montfort Walker, senior vice president and general manager, Oracle Food and Beverage. “With a highly-complex kitchen including multiple dining concepts across a large footprint, organization and fast-access to information was the key to success for Helbiz Kitchen. With Simphony, orders are routed to the right place so they can be processed and delivered at just the right time. On the backend, all the data is centralized to provide an easy snapshot of what is selling and what isn’t, inventory position, food waste, and more. We look forward to helping Helbiz Kitchen extend their success in new regions and continue to provide consumers an exceptional off-premises dining experience.”
The Oracle Simphony platform serves brands in over 180 countries and is available in 19 languages. The platform provides comprehensive fiscal and tax standards per local requirements enabling ambitious restaurant operators to avoid being weighed down by the complexity of international expansion, and the ability to focus growth opportunities.

Announcing the OCI DevOps service: A complete CI/CD platform
Jonathan Schreiber | December 14, 2021 | 5 minute read
Sr. Principal Product Manager
We’re excited to announce the general availability of continuous integration (CI) features from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) DevOps service! This launch builds on our existing continuous deployment (CD) features to deliver a complete end-to-end CI/CD platform in OCI commercial regions. Developers can now commit their source code to a DevOps code repository, build, and test software artifacts with a build runner, deliver artifacts to OCI repositories, and then run a deployment to OCI platforms.
Whether developers are building a new cloud native application or migrating an existing application to OCI, the DevOps service is here to simplify their software delivery process. Using the DevOps service developers can automate each phase of their software delivery lifecycle, to release features more quickly and with fewer errors.
Simplify your software delivery lifecycle
DevOps is the process of continually improving how engineering teams deliver software. Recent studies of engineering team capabilities have shown that DevOps capabilities are positively correlated to business success. If your team can safely release features more frequently than your competitors, your customers get more value from your software.
OCI’s CI/CD Platform
With the release of code repositories and build pipelines features from the DevOps service, developers now have a full CI/CD platform available to simplify and improve software delivery on OCI. If you’re embarking on a new project, you can use DevOps as a complete CI/CD platform on OCI. Mirror an existing GitHub or GitLab repository to OCI Code Repositories to speed up your builds. From your commit, quickly run concurrent builds with DevOps Build Pipelines and kick off a Deployment to OCI platforms: Compute hosts (virtual machine and bare metal), Oracle Kubernetes Engine (managed Kubernetes) clusters, and Oracle Functions (serverless functions).
You might also move an existing application (from on-premises or another cloud) to OCI and want to move software delivery and deployments to OCI platforms. The OCI DevOps service has the flexibility to integrate with your existing CI/CD workflows. If you’re migrating and want to keep your existing CI workflow, such as ones in Jenkins, you can move your deployment process to DevOps and trigger a deployment from an existing CI pipeline to orchestrate your release steps with DevOps deployment pipelines.
The OCI DevOps service works with and is part of the fabric of the OCI platform. Instead of managing your team in a separate CI/CD platform, you can set up access for your team with Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and policies. With OCI DevOps, you can secure your builds and deployments with least privilege access to OCI resources needed. Artifacts generated by your build and used in your deployment are stored in OCI Artifact repositories. Logs from your build runs and deployments are in the OCI Logging service for audit and governance, and your team can receive notifications from the events of your DevOps pipelines through the Notifications services.
Developer-friendly DevOps
The DevOps service doesn’t charge per-user, you only pay for the compute and storage that your build pipelines and code repositories use. The DevOps service scales service managed build runners with your team. So, you can run concurrent builds and don’t need to manage or operate the underlying build runner hosts. A DevOps project gives you a home to view your complete software delivery lifecycle. All your source code repositories, build pipelines, deployment pipelines, and pointers to artifacts and environments are in one place.
DevOps speed and reliability
With build pipelines, you can integrate tests in your build instructions. With deployment pipelines, you can create a progressive delivery release to validate your recent changes in development and staging environments before releasing them to production users. From a DevOps deployment, you can recover from an issue in production by rolling back a delivery stage.
From our customers and partners
Thomson Reuters accelerated their migration on to OCI using the DevOps service. Nagaraju Kammara, SRE technical lead at Thomson Reuters, said,
“As our Cloud teams are already well versed in designing and running fully automated cloud applications, we found the Oracle DevOps Service easy to adopt and are happy as it is an OCI-native tool. Our Landing Zone Service team saw significant improvements in our developer efficiency by using OCI DevOps Service and it enabled us to streamline our deployments in OCI.”
BizDoc Storage is using the OCI DevOps service to speed up their software delivery pipeline. Jim Geldermann, Director of Technology, BizDoc Storage says:
“BizDoc Storage is in the document conversion and management business. We have been using microservices for a long time, even before they gained popularity. Oracle DevOps service has successfully replaced our previous software development lifecycle (SDLC) system, helping us build and push code in 90-120 seconds.”
Deloitte is a well-known Oracle Cloud Infrastructure partner with experience using the OCI DevOps Service. According to Chris Pasternak, Managing Director, Deloitte Consulting LLP:
“Deloitte teams with Oracle to enable digital transformation at some of the world’s largest organizations. OCI DevOps Service can help our clients build value as developers can develop, build, test, and deploy cloud-native and traditional software with speed and scale. The service is built directly into Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and can help Deloitte clients deliver lower overall operating costs through faster deployments and greater reliability.”
We look forward to hearing how you use OCI DevOps with your projects!

The Newest Security Innovations from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
Bala Chandran | November 9, 2021 | 5 minute read
VP, Oracle Software Development, Security Platform
We hear often from customers that traditional cloud security is too hard.  They have too many security tools, too many security vendors, and too much security complexity as they strive to keep all their applications and cloud tenancies secure. According to the Oracle and KPMG Cloud Threat Report, 78 percent of organizations use more than 50 discrete cybersecurity products to address security issues. In fact, Gartner® recognizes that “through 2025, more than 99% of cloud breaches will have a root cause of preventable misconfigurations or mistakes by end users""¹. We believe there is a better way to address cloud security. For many customers, implementing security requires stitching together a set of disparate tools. In contrast, OCI offers built-in security services, at no additional cost, that don’t require complex integrations. As part of our ongoing innovations to make it easier for organizations to secure their cloud data, today we are announcing four new and enhanced security services that are integrated, make security simple, and offer prescriptive guidance: OCI Web Application Firewall for Flexible Load Balancers, OCI Vulnerability Scanning Service, OCI Bastion, and OCI Certificates.
Oracle Cloud Security Success to Date
These new and enhanced services complement our existing OCI security innovations, including Oracle Cloud Guard and Oracle Security Zones. In September 2020, Clay Magouyrk, executive vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure recognized that “Security has been a critical design consideration across Oracle Cloud for years. We believe security should be foundational and built in, and customers shouldn’t be forced to make tradeoffs between security and cost. With Oracle Cloud Guard and Oracle Maximum Security Zones’ security automation and embedded expertise, customers can feel confident running their business-critical workloads on Oracle Cloud.”
Customers and analysts have also recognized the value of Cloud Guard and Security Zones:
Motorola Solutions Inc.’s Scott Shepard, Senior Director of IT Infrastructure and Information Security recently stated that “Oracle Cloud Guard gave us greater security monitoring capabilities, including the ability to shift from merely detecting security vulnerabilities to responding and enforcing security policy. We have also been able to see a 15% reduction in our financial spend in the security space by consolidating and leveraging Oracle Cloud Guard.”
Kuppinger Cole’s Mike Small wrote in a recent Executive View that “Oracle Cloud Guard strongly matches KuppingerCole's recommended functionality for Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) within the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.”
Omdia Research’s Maxine Holt, Senior Research Director for Cybersecurity, wrote “Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has taken a robust approach to cloud security, with strong security controls easily available for free.”             
Ongoing Security Innovations
As part of our innovation cycle, we believe it is important that we continuously enhance and expand our foundational security capabilities. We are focused on helping organizations reduce risk by providing a growing set of security capabilities that are simple, prescriptive, and integrated while keeping security as a design principle across OCI. Oracle has taken an integrated security services approach, which reduces the burden on our customers, enabling them to focus more time on improving their core business.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Web Application Firewall (OCI WAF) for Flexible Load Balancers—OCI WAF is a cloud-based security service that helps protect an organization’s web applications from malicious and unwanted internet traffic. Now customers can directly apply and enforce OCI WAF protection on their Flexible Load Balancer (both Public and Private) instances. WAF enforcement on the Flexible Load Balancer helps further strengthen the security posture of your applications by protecting them from the common web vulnerabilities, as identified by OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities, allowing customers to secure both their internet-facing as well as their internal application workloads. In addition, we are introducing a new flexible and simplified pricing for OCI WAF comprised of two components—WAF Instance and WAF Requests. The service is available to try in the Oracle Free Cloud trial.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Scanning Service (OCI VSS) is now available to help customers identify and address risks from unpatched vulnerabilities and open ports by assessing and monitoring cloud hosts. We integrated OCI VSS with Cloud Guard to enable customers to quickly and automatically identify vulnerabilities and common misconfigurations to help them improve the security postures of their OCI instances. The service is available to all OCI customers at no additional cost.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Bastion (OCI Bastion) helps customers gain restricted and time-limited secure access to resources that don’t have public endpoints and require strict resource access controls. OCI Bastion service is a fully managed service providing secure and ephemeral Secure Shell (SSH) access to the private resources in OCI. Like the bastion fortress of medieval times, the service improves security posture by providing an additional layer of defense against external threats. The service is available in the OCI Free Tier and is included with OCI paid tenancies.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Certificates (OCI Certificates) is a new cloud X.509 certificate service designed to help solve the issue of certificate management for Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections. OCI Certificates service enables customers to easily create private Certificate Authority (CA) hierarchies and TLS certificates and then deploy them to integrated services such as the load balancer and API gateway. These certificates are backed by a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 Hardware Security Module (HSM). The service has taken a long, and sometimes confusing, process of creating and managing CAs and certificates and made it simple. OCI Certificates service is available in the OCI Free Tier and is included with OCI paid tenancies.
Security Integrated by Design
Customers shouldn’t be forced to make tradeoffs between security and cost as they use the cloud. Instead, cloud security should be foundational and built in. By integrating our newest security services into Cloud Guard and Security Zones, we provide continuous monitoring of security posture and enforce security policy so that it’s harder to make configuration errors in the first place.
Here are quotes from our customers who have tried out our newest services:
National Roads and Motoring Association (NRMA)’s Trevor Rangel, General Manager, Technology Security and Architecture, shared that “Cloud Guard and Vulnerability Scanning Service meant that the lag time from discovery to remediation is shortened greatly.”
Advanced Laboratory Economics and Finance (ALEF)’s Pietro Lascari, Delivery Manager, recognized that “Cloud Guard is easy to use but powerful to keep our security posture. OCI Certificates helps to be compliant with the regulators, external and internal auditors.”
Try New Oracle Cloud Security Services Today
You can try out the new Oracle Cloud Infrastructure security services to experience security that is integrated, simple, and offers prescriptive guidance across IaaS and SaaS. There is no cost for many of our cloud security services and they are included services with paid tenancies.  You can try the newly announced services with the 30-day free trial. I invite you to watch our announcement where we share the latest updates, show a demonstration of the integration of all four new security services, and hear from our customers.

Eric Pan | October 7, 2021 | 5 minute read
Oracle Cloud: The Ideal Platform for VMware with Control, Security and Predictability
This week at VMworld 2021, along with a lively fireside chat between VMware CEO Raghu Raghuram and Oracle CTO Larry Ellison, we were proud to share the latest updates on Oracle Cloud VMware Solution, discuss our alliance and broadening roadmap with VMware, show off an exciting technology demo on Arm-based servers and showcase some recent joint customers.
Two years ago at OpenWorld 2019, Oracle and VMware executives Clay Magouyrk and John Gilmartin announced a mutual technical support agreement for Oracle products running on VMware environments and introduced the Oracle Cloud VMware Solution. Since we launched the Oracle Cloud VMware Solution last year, we now have over 50 customers who have deployed over 10,000 cores and this momentum continues to grow. Some of our recent successful customers include the following companies:
Rumo Logistica is a major railway company that runs approximately 14K kilometers of rail lines in Brazil, transporting 26% of all grains and 30% of the world's sugar exported from the country. They migrated their data centers to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and VMware estate to Oracle Cloud VMware Solution to manage their railway operations, supplies, billing, and human resources workloads. Rumo selected Oracle Cloud VMware Solution for its full-fidelity VMware experience without making any architectural changes. As a result, they achieved 20% reduction in infrastructure cost. They completed migration to OCI in just three months, with zero business interruption. Rumo is a 24/7 operation and couldn't afford any downtime. They're the first railroad in Brazil to enable digital transformation to operate 100% in the cloud.
Maxim's is a Hong Kong-based food and beverage company that operates over 1,700 stores throughout Asia. Maxim's needed Oracle Cloud VMware Solution for extra capacity and business continuity of critical applications in their on-premises VMware estate. They chose Oracle because of its longstanding strategic partnership and consistent post-sales support. With Oracle Cloud VMware Solution, they dramatically improved systems capacity to meet the infrastructure needs of 1,700 stores and scalability for growth. Oracle Cloud VMware Solution saved 65% operational costs compared to on-premises VMware deployment. Disaster protection for production systems gave Maxim's a reduction in their recovery time objective to about five minutes.
TIM Brasil is a Brazilian telecommunications operator with over 61 million customers. They needed a VMware solution to adopt a cloud-first strategy for digitizing their business applications while maintaining compatibility with existing on-premises systems. They selected Oracle Cloud VMware Solution for its compatibility with VMware SnapClone and HCX. Both features were a critical decision factor in their analysis. Oracle Cloud VMware Solution enabled TIM Brasil to quickly migrate into the cloud and maintain compatibility with Red Hat Linux-their OS standard.
Oracle Cloud VMware Solution supports VMware today and into the future
Oracle is focused on innovation, flexibility, customer choice. We continue to deepen how Oracle and VMware are working together. This week at VMworld, we're announcing preview support for VMware Horizon on Oracle Cloud VMware Solution. We're also announcing upcoming support for VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid natively within OCI and Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE).
With those exciting announcements, we have several upcoming capabilities and features for Oracle Cloud VMware Solution.

The Full Story
Oracle Verrazzano Enterprise Container Platform addresses the needs described above and enables you to:
Deploy, manage, and secure container-based applications in Kubernetes.
Unify application lifecycle management across microservices and traditional WebLogic Server applications.
Standardize management across Kubernetes clusters on-premises, on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and on other public clouds.
Metaphorically, Oracle Verrazzano is a bridge between worlds: on-premises and the cloud. Technically speaking, Oracle Verrazzano is a container deployment and management platform that embodies the core requirements and design principles of cloud-native application development. It runs on top of Kubernetes – on-premises and in the cloud – and enables you to deploy your container applications to any of the Kubernetes clusters where Verrazzano is installed.
Oracle Verrazzano Enterprise Container Platform is part of Oracle’s extensive portfolio of standards-based open software technologies for cloud native application development, deployment, and lifecycle management in Oracle Cloud, other clouds, and on-premises. For more information about Oracle cloud native products and services, see https://www.oracle.com/cloud-native/.
Benefits of Oracle Verrazzano Enterprise Container Platform
Benefits of using Oracle Verrazzano include:
Improving application developer productivity and accelerating innovation. 
By adopting containers and container management technologies, and by adopting the design principles of DevOps and cloud-native application development, you can decrease deployment times, increase application uptime, and spend more developer time solving business problems. Verrazzano takes this a step further with an assembled and automated complementary technology stack that further reduces time needed to roll out and manage your applications on Day 1, Day 2, and Day 102.
Modernizing your existing applications using your choice of microservices or traditional WebLogic Server application technologies within each business application.
Oracle Verrazzano builds on the Oracle WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit by enabling you to easily move your application to containers and to Kubernetes, and to automate the deployment of the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator, provisioning of a WebLogic domain, configuring access to the application, and collecting metrics and log records for the domain and application.
Realize cloud native benefits without lock-in. 
Oracle Verrazzano provides a cloud-neutral approach to achieve the same automation, observability, and lifecycle benefits for all of your container applications, regardless of where you are deploying your applications: on-premises, on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, or on other public clouds. 
Oracle Verrazzano Enterprise Container Platform is a curated collection of open source components that are provisioned as an opinionated stack designed to provide the following features: 
Intelligent workload management across Kubernetes clusters running in the cloud or on-premises with automatic provisioning of select operators, creation of Kubernetes objects, application modeling for advanced deployment scenarios, and extended features for WebLogic, Coherence, and Helidon workloads. The result is reduced operational overhead, portability across clouds, and increased flexibility for managing containerized applications.
Automated, built-in observability for system and application components, including metrics and log collection from all managed workloads, and pre-configured dashboards, which reduces overhead and improves application manageability and uptime.
Application lifecycle management with optimized cross-cluster updates with DevOps and GitOps enablement, which also reduces overhead and improves uptime. 
Polyglot workload enablement with built-in application handling for Java and non-Java applications. A single DevOps platform for all of your container applications reduces complexity and overhead, and promotes standardization.
Kubernetes infrastructure management with deep visibility and management of underlying Kubernetes clusters, which enables faster problem detection and root cause analysis.
Multi-level platform security with protection for network traffic, system components, and application components to reduce overhead and risk.
Cross-cloud consistency. With Verrazzano, you get a consistent platform for container applications that you can run on-premises, in Oracle Cloud, and in third party clouds. It uses popular open source technologies such as Prometheus and Grafana, making it is easy to adopt and work into your workflows with reduced management overhead and reduced adoption costs.
Getting Started with Oracle Verrazzano Enterprise Container Platform
The easiest way to get started with Verrazzano is to install the Verrazzano platform operator in your Kubernetes cluster, and then apply an installation profile (e.g., dev or prod), which is passed as a Kubernetes custom resource to the operator. Quick start instructions are available at https://verrazzano.io/docs/quickstart/. If you don’t have access to a full-blown Kubernetes environment, you can run on KIND or MiniKube. Instructions are available at https://verrazzano.io/docs/setup/platforms/.
Deploying Applications with Oracle Verrazzano
Oracle Verrazzano uses the Open Application Model specification so that developers can create container applications that are agnostic to the environment in which they will run. Application operators can then assemble those applications and provide environment-specific traits and scopes when deploying the applications. All of this is driven by DevOps- and GitOps-friendly YAML files. 
Open Application Model is a community-driven specification aimed at improving developer productivity and application portability. Oracle extended the specification in Verrazzano for Oracle WebLogic Server, Oracle Coherence, and Helidon applications. For each of these application types, Verrazzano determines the distinct application handling required, and deploys additional operators and other resources as needed.
When you deploy an application in Verrazzano, the system automatically takes the following actions:
Distributes Kubernetes custom resources for the application to the cluster where the application will be deployed.
Creates namespaces for the application.
Copies secrets to the namespace.
For Oracle WebLogic Server domains and Oracle Coherence clusters, deploys required operators and passes custom resources to the operators. For these and for other applications, the system creates a Kubernetes deployment and a Kubernetes service.
Creates network policies in the Istio service mesh.
Creates an ingress into the service mesh.
Sets up metric and log record transfers to the Verrazzano observability stack.

Maintain application availability in your data center with Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager
John Priest | May 20, 2021 | 3 minute read
Director of Product Management
Oracle is pleased to announce the general availability of Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager Disaster Recovery
Server virtualization platforms like Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager offer a number of advanced features including Live Migration and VM high availability to ensure that applications continue running in your data center. However, if your data center loses power or is taken offline due to a natural disaster, these advanced features will not work without the compute, storage, or networking infrastructure to run your applications. The high availability features protect against individual component failures; but Disaster Recovery capabilities are required to protect against site-wide outages.
Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager 4.3 now supports Disaster Recovery features to connect multiple data centers and further protect your critical business applications. The Disaster Recovery features can be used in either an active-active configuration or an active-passive configuration to keep applications available to your end users even when a disaster might strike your data center. Oracle has fully tested the Disaster Recovery solutions based on the open source oVirt project and offers them as a feature of Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager.
Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager Disaster Recovery
Disaster Recovery features supported by Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager include:
Active-Active Disaster Recovery: Active-active disaster recovery uses a stretch cluster configuration. This means that there is a single Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager environment with a cluster that contains hosts capable of running the required virtual machines in the primary and secondary site. The virtual machines in the primary site can automatically migrate to hosts in the secondary site if an outage occurs.
Active-Passive Disaster Recovery: Active-passive disaster recovery is a site-to-site failover solution. Two separate Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager environments are configured: the active primary environment and the passive secondary (backup) environment. With active-passive disaster recovery, you must manually execute failover and failback (when needed) both of which are performed using Ansible playbooks.
Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager errata release
The latest Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager 4.3.10 errata release also includes:
LUN scalability increase: The storage scalability limits have been increased to 2,000 LUNs per storage domain to allow users to safely add additional LUNs and increase the number of Virtual Machines that can be deployed.
Bug fixes and security updates: A number of RPMs have been updated to incorporate bug fixes and security patches.
More information on these updates can be found in the Release Notes and the Administration Guide located in the Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager Document Library.
Updating or upgrading Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager
Customers that have already deployed Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager 4.3 can update to the latest 4.3.10 updates using the Oracle Linux yum server or the Oracle Unbreakable Linux Network. Users will access the oVirt 4.3 channel and execute a couple of commands:
Copy code snippet
# yum update ovirt\*setup\*
Copy code snippet
# engine-setup
New deployments of Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager can also be done using the same oVirt43 yum channels. For new Oracle Linux KVM host deployments, installation media (ISO images) are available from the Oracle Linux yum server. Additional information on updating, upgrading, or installing Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager and KVM hosts can be found in the Getting Started Guide.
Both Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager and Oracle Linux can be downloaded, used, and distributed free of charge and all updates and errata are freely available.
Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager Support
The Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager Disaster Recovery solution can be easily deployed to configure, monitor, manage, and maintain service uptime for an Oracle Linux KVM environment with enterprise-grade performance and support from Oracle. Support for Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager is available to customers with an Oracle Linux Premier Support subscription. Refer to Oracle Linux Support for information about Oracle Linux support levels.

Jenny Tsai
Vice President, Overall Database Product Management at Oracle
Published May 19, 2021

Much has been said about how pay-as-you-go cloud computing reduces the cost of big research projects compared to running those workloads on-premises. But there’s been less talk about how databases with built-in machine learning algorithms and model building capabilities are a killer combo for researchers who need to parse reams of data to spot meaningful patterns and/or outliers in their subject area. 
Typically, a data scientist or data engineer extracts the data and funnels it from the data store to a machine learning service to build and train models. Since model building involves fine-tuning over time, there is much continuous tweaking – and lots of data flowing around.
However, in most scenarios in the public cloud, the database is here and the machine learning service is over there, which introduces latency, or delay as the data travels back and forth. In addition, the more data moves between various points in or between clouds, the more opportunity there is for bad actors to intercept, view, steal, and/or manipulate it. The situation gets more complicated if a research project involves different data types handled by separate databases operating throughout one or more clouds.
That’s the type of set up that drives data scientists crazy. Ask a group of these specialists what their biggest pain point is, and nine times out of ten, they will say it is data extraction, data loading, plus data transformation. All those data flows mentioned above require an awful lot of wrangling.
By baking machine learning processes right into the database itself, security exposures due to data transmission are minimized. As data volumes expand, the ability to analyze and process the data in place can significantly reduce time to deployment. Why move the data to the algorithms if you can move the algorithms to the data?
That integration of machine learning capabilities into the database is a win for data scientists, as well as business executives who can now focus more on what questions they want to address with their analysis and less on wrangling bits and bytes of that data."

Announcing new Oracle Analytics Cloud innovations
T.K. Anand | May 3, 2021 | 5 minute read
Senior Vice President, Analytics
Automating the analytics workflow to help users predict outcomes through richer interactions with data
I’m very happy to announce a set of new capabilities in Oracle Analytics Cloud to provide all employees —not just data specialists— with easy-to-use, self-service analytics. Customers can now experience interactions with their data via maps, visual market basket analysis, and mobile devices to more quickly identify patterns and relationships that allow them to predict outcomes and make faster decisions.
The enhancements to Oracle Analytics Cloud include explainable machine learning, data preparation for transforming customer-specific data into quality information, built-in text analytics, affinity analysis, custom reference knowledge, graph analytics, custom map analytics, natural language queries, and narratives, as well as a new mobile app. 
“Oracle’s innovation in AI-based automation in all phases of the analytics and business intelligence continuum delivers insights, recommendations, and actions in the context of enterprise-wide business activities that accelerate desired outcomes,” said Dan Vesset, Group Vice President, Analytics and Information Management, IDC.
New Innovations in Oracle Analytics Cloud
Key new capabilities include:
Explainable Machine Learning: Any user can now see simple explanations of the factors that influenced a machine learning model to predict a certain outcome. In addition, they can interact with a model, adjusting factors to fine-tune the results. For example, of all the factors that influenced the denial of a bank loan application, users can quickly see which were the most determinant and why? 
Automated Data Preparation: A data profiling engine samples and scans data to identify and proactively prompt users about potential data quality issues, like automatically suggesting the obfuscation of sensitive credit card information or social security number. It can enrich zip codes with city, population, income, ethnicity, and payment data to provide more in-depth location analysis. Users can further enrich data by uploading more business-specific data, such as sales regions, delivery zones, or product categories.
Text Analytics: Text analytics enables you to extract words from unstructured data, count them, visualize the results, and then join that analysis with your original data so you can drill into any level of detail. For example, sentiment analysis uses text analytics to determine whether comments are negative, positive, or neutral, enabling users to understand how their brand is perceived or how a product launch is performing based on text in surveys or social media. 
Affinity Analysis: Discover relationships in your data by identifying sets of items that often appear together. This data mining technique is also known as association rule learning. A common and useful application of it is market basket analysis in consumer goods or retail banking, where users can obtain the probability of different products being purchased together to make marketing decisions. When developing promotions, retailers often look at popular combinations to develop their strategies for increasing product sales. For example, shoppers who buy cereal often also buy milk at the same time. Understanding this co-occurrence of items in a collection helps retailers better manage store layout, coupon offers, and cross-selling, and is valuable for direct marketing, sales promotions, and discovering business trends. 
Graph Analytics: Graph analytics show data relationships visually, such as how people and transactions are connected or the shortest distance between two hubs in a network.  Using Oracle Analytics Cloud, anyone can easily analyze graph data in the Autonomous Data Warehouse. This has powerful applications in a variety of various domains, from marketing and social media to security and compliance. For example, pathfinding lets a user find the shortest path between two points; another common use of graph analytics is for ranking and measuring the importance of website pages.  
Custom Map Analytics: Map analytics gives users the ability to apply custom images as map backgrounds and create map layers to enhance data visualizations. For example, doctors can visualize data on an image of the human body to identify areas that require attention and visually track the impact of medication or other treatments. Maps can be loaded into OAC or hosted on a web server as a dynamic background using the Web Map Service (WMS) protocol and XYZ tile layers. This enables customers to use map information they might not have access to in their enterprise, such as weather and building schematics, and easily present it with their business data.
 
Figure 1 –Custom map analytics dashboard with human body image layers, charts, and indicators.

 
Figure 2 – Custom map analytics airport dashboard with a gate grid heat map by airline, and satellite images with overlaid traffic information.
New Oracle Analytics Mobile App: The new Oracle Analytics mobile app lets users find data quickly and easily, all with a consistent user experience across Oracle Analytics Cloud and the app. It lets users interact with data visualizations, explore dashboards, and share information across teams for further collaboration. Users can also listen to natural-language generated audio narratives of the most salient points from reports, dashboards, and visualizations.
 
Figure 3 – Oracle Analytics Mobile iOS app
  Figure 4 – Oracle Analytics Mobile Android
Natural Language Processing: Oracle Analytics Cloud allows users to query their data in natural language using a simple search-like experience—using text or voice— and obtain spoken narratives of the results. It supports 28 different languages and various language constructs such as synonyms, abbreviations, dynamic filters, and calculations. Users can type, text, or speak aloud to ask business questions, such as, “what’s our employee churn this month?” and get an employee attrition dashboard in return. Oracle Analytics Cloud not only accepts natural language as input, but it also outputs natural language narratives that explain the results of the query. It has an embedded natural-language generation engine that understands the context of the data a user is looking at and automatically updates the narrative as the user adds data, changes filters, or otherwise changes the context as in a typical data discovery and analysis process.
In summary, we now offer a richer set of capabilities that power the entire analytics workflow, from connecting to a data source, transforming and preparing the data, modeling the data, to exploring it, and sharing results with other users —all within a rich and engaging user experience.  
These latest updates are reflective of our focus on innovation and responding to our customers’ needs. This is why we are particularly excited to branch out into new ways our customers can share data and analyses in the form of “data stories” —all through a single, extensible cloud analytics platform that allows everyone to create custom visual experiences with little or no code.
 
Finally, don’t forget to watch the Oracle Live session where I discuss these latest innovations and share demos.

What’s another word for volunteering? In this series, we’re asking nonprofit organizations to make up words that describe what Oracle Volunteers' contributions mean to them.
Would you ever mistake a piece of plastic for your next meal?
Probably not.
But to sea turtles, a plastic bag floating in the ocean looks a lot like their favorite food, jellyfish. In fact, this mistake proves fatal for nearly one fourth of sea turtles who end up consuming plastic.
In total, plastic pollution impacts nearly 700 species in the ocean. It’s not surprising when you learn that an estimated 8 million metric tons of plastics enter the ocean every year on top of the estimated 150 million metric tons that currently circulate in marine environments. Whether its errant plastic bags and straws finding their way into gutters, or mismanaged plastic waste flowing out of rapidly growing economies, the equivalent of one garbage truck full of plastic ends up in the ocean every minute of every day of the year.
Yikes.
While these statistics are staggering, there are actions we can take to help heal our blue planet. And change begins with gloves, a litter picker, a trash bucket or bag, a smartphone, and you.
""Clean Swell represents a growing global movement to make beaches, waterways, and the ocean trash-free.""
Allison Schutes, Director of the International Cleanup, Ocean Conservancy
To help turn the tide on plastic pollution, Oracle Volunteering teamed up with Ocean Conservancy to organize our first-ever global cleanup, encouraging employees to pick up trash along the shores of their local waterways, beaches, parks and neighborhoods. Volunteers log their cleanup efforts in the Ocean Conservancy’s easy-to-use Clean Swell app, which provides researchers and policymakers with valuable insight into how we’re making the ocean ecosystem cleaner and healthier.
These cleanups are taking place as part of Focus on Environment, our global initiative that encourages employees around the world to roll up their sleeves and take action for a healthy planet in March and April.
To date, more than 1,400 Oracle Volunteers have committed to cleanups, which has so far prevented over 13,700 pieces of trash from ending up in the ocean.
“What makes the International Coastal Cleanup so unique and valuable is that volunteers collect itemized data on what they’re finding. Especially during the pandemic, this has really been possible through our mobile app, Clean Swell. It represents a growing global movement to make beaches, waterways, and the ocean trash-free,” said Allison Schutes, Director of the International Cleanup at Ocean Conservancy. “We’re grateful to the Oracle Volunteers and their families who’ve spent several weeks picking up litter and tracking what they’ve found. And, we hope they’ll keep going!” 
Plastic pollution remains an enormous threat to the ocean ecosystem and, in turn, to us. Indeed, to life on earth. The ocean produces over half of the world's oxygen and absorbs 50 times more carbon dioxide than our atmosphere, not to mention the food and enjoyment it provides us. So, this Earth Day, and any day you find yourself out and about, we invite you to embark on a cleanup of your own to protect the ocean and the planet. A sea turtle, hundreds of other marine species, and all of us, will thank you.

How DeepZen technology gives audio content a natural voice people want to hear
The last few months have highlighted society’s need for different forms of, ideally, human communication. This has often been consumed on screen, but for many there has been a growing need for audio information.
With education and learning taking on different scenarios, often from home, there have been barriers that limit the amount of quality audio material available and often high costs to organisations who want to provide content in this rich form. 
International author and technology advisor, Bernard Marr said: ‘Many people are turning more and more to audio books, and learning through listening and podcasts, but they do not want to hear the robotic, monotone, synthetic voices that we’re all familiar with. There is a need for real, natural sounding, voices that people can connect with, voices that give them more of the experience of real, human communication.
‘In particular, providing good quality audio content for those who are visually impaired, and people with dyslexia and learning difficulties, who are struggling without face to face interactions, could change everything.’
London-based AI company, DeepZen, is tackling these challenges, and bringing its AI voice technology to life to solve real problems.
DeepZen’s technology turns written text into natural-sounding speech that conveys a wide range of human emotions, and it is transforming the production of audio content for learning and training organisations by providing a cost-effective, quick, and convenient way to produce natural-sounding voice content.
DeepZen recently partnered with BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT, for an AI audio book pilot, in support of its commitment to increase access to its publications for the visually impaired and support new forms of professional content consumption. BCS hopes to convert over 60 professional IT titles to audio books in the near future.
Charles Rumball, Director of Publishing Sales at BCS said:  ‘DeepZen’s technology has exceeded our expectations. We are very impressed with the quality of the voice, which is almost indistinguishable from a human voice. The conversion is the best we’ve seen in the market. Working with DeepZen was also more cost-effective than traditional methods and cut down production time by 60-70%.’
 ‘We believe in the ethical use of technology. Utilising new technology and bringing it to our customers in the right way is very important to us – and we believe DeepZen does that.’
DeepZen, a member of Oracle for Startups, produces the world’s first digitally narrated audiobooks to be sold across major platforms and literary distributors including Apple Books and Google Play, as well as producing voice-over content for corporate training, and marketing, advertising and content production companies. The applications for voice synthesis are wide ranging and DeepZen has been able to move extremely quickly by running high performance computing on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).
Taylan Kamis, DeepZen CEO and co-founder said: ‘We have developed exclusive AI emotive voice technology which synthesizes the human voice, conveys real emotions, and mimics the natural patterns and intonation of the human voice, and it is revolutionising the way audio books and other forms of audio content are produced.’
The technology is currently being applied across multiple industries including book publishing, gaming, podcasting, voiceovers, Apps, and training and education, and the potential applications are virtually limitless.
TrepCamp, a training academy that focuses on developing the next generation of successful entrepreneurs, recently partnered with DeepZen to help train aspiring entrepreneurs to develop the skills and mindset to become high-impact entrepreneurs. 
Isabel Aranda, Global Operations Manager, TrepCamp said: ‘We are using DeepZen’s technology to produce voice content for our key programme, the Entrepreneurial Simulator Programme. The first four weeks of this eight-week programme are usually online learning, but this year our 1,000 students will do the whole programme online.’
Graduates have gone on to launch successful disruptor businesses in education, fintech, and mental health and wellbeing, and the best students get the opportunity to travel to the US to do advanced programmes at New York University, Stanford or University of California–Berkeley.
Andrea Przybyslawski, analyst at TrepCamp said: ‘It’s perfect. Before, our audio content was produced by people recording themselves, often at home, and you could hear background noises and telephones ringing. We had to spend hours a week recording it and then editing it. DeepZen’s technology was really fast for us, and the quality was so much better than what we had produced ourselves.
 ‘Now we’ve found a better way of doing things, and it’s saved us a lot of time,’ added Isabel. ‘With DeepZen we can just send over the content and forget about it, and focus on what we know how to do best.’
In the last 12 months, DeepZen has signed three co-publishing deals in the UK, signed Worldwide distribution deals, and produced tens of audio books with hundreds more in the pipeline.
‘We are on a mission to unlock the potential of audio consumption globally, and bring the amazing benefits of our cutting-edge technology to the widest possible audience,’ said Taylan Kamis.
 DeepZen’s synthetic voices are based on the voices of human narrators, who are fully paid for their work. Together with Oracle, it has built the editorial tools which allow it to turn a client’s text into life-like voiceover content, based on a voice that has been choosen from a library of voices, and filled with all of the emotions and emphasis of a human voice. 
Oracle’s OCI Graphical Processing Unit compute shape is important and effective for artificial intelligence applications and neural networks, and is now an essential part of DeepZen’s business model. The system can read any text as a human would do and has reduced the process and complexity of creating audio books from months to weeks, at a significant cost reduction versus traditional studio production methods.

Announcing Oracle Cloud Compute E4 platform on third gen AMD EPYC processors
Rajan Panchapakesan | March 15, 2021 | 7 minute read
DIRECTOR OF PRODUCT MANAGEMENT, OCI COMPUTE
At Oracle OpenWorld 2018, we announced a strategic partnership with AMD and launched the Oracle E2 platform on the first generation of AMD EPYC processors. Since that launch, we’ve deployed Oracle E2 Compute instances to all of our commercial regions. Eighteen months later, in April 2020, we built on this partnership and launched the E3 platform on the second generation. Many of our enterprise customers and Oracle Cloud applications are running general-purpose workloads on AMD EPYC processors. Today, I’m happy to announce that Oracle is launching the E4 platform based on third-generation AMD EPYC processors. The E4 platform includes both bare metal and flexible virtual machines (VMs).
These E4 standard instances use 64 core processors, with a base clock frequency of 2.55 GHz and a max boost of up to 3.5 GHz. The bare metal E4 standard Compute instance supports 128 OCPUs (128 cores and 256 threads) with 256 MB of L3 cache, 2 TB of RAM, and 100 Gbps of overall network bandwidth. This configuration is the highest core count for a bare metal instance on any public cloud. The memory bandwidth is well suited for both general-purpose and high-bandwidth workloads that require larger and faster memory.
As demonstrated in the following performance benchmarks, the E4 Standard instances deliver up to an estimated 15% increase in integer performance, an estimated 21% increase in floating point performance, and a 24% increase in Java performance, compared to E3 Standard instances. Also, the E4 instances provide three times better price performance relative to other general-purpose instances offered by other cloud providers.
New processors, better performance, and the same price as E3 Compute instances, combined with our flexible Compute approach, which enables you to granularly customize the core counts and memory of VMs, provide better value.
Many enterprise customers for Oracle applications and general-purpose workloads have adopted our AMD EPYC processor-based Compute instances. Our customers have already successfully deployed AMD-based instances, including the following use cases:
Video conferencing
Real-time video processing
Massively parallel processing and high-performance computing (HPC)
Business-critical applications
Web and application servers
Backend servers for enterprise applications
Gaming servers
In-memory database
Caching fleets
App development environments
Oracle customer Xactly, the leader in revenue intelligence solutions, uses Oracle’s AMD EPYC processor-based Compute.
“Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is unique in providing customers with the granularity and flexibility in compute resources,” said Ron Rasmussen, CTO of Xactly. “Xactly has seen great, measured benefits from deploying E3 in operating our multi-tenant SaaS revenue intelligence solutions. Our multitenant SaaS solution is built on Java technology, and we look forward to extending the additional benefits of E4 to our customers in the near future.”
Key highlights
E4 instances continue the flexible infrastructure approach that we established with E3. You’re free to select the exact number of OCPUs and amount of memory that you need for a VM, not forced to choose from a fixed menu of 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. You can launch any custom VM size that meets your needs, such as a 3-core, 6-core, or 63-core VM with anywhere from 1 GB–1 TB of memory.
These custom sizes mean lower costs. E4 instances bill separately for the OCPU and memory resources provisioned. Each OCPU comes with its associated simultaneous multithreading unit and is priced at US$0.025, and memory is priced at US$0.0015 per GB—the same prices as our E3 Compute instances. An E4 instance with 1-OCPU instance and 16 GB of RAM  has a price of US$0.049, which is 23% less than X7 Standard and 57–61% less than comparable instances offered by other clouds.
E4 instances support reboot resize, so you can easily migrate from your existing compute instances to an E4 instance of compatible shape.
Instance availability
Table 1 shows the VM and the bare metal instances that are available at launch. These instances are available in the following regions, with plans to have instances widely available in all commercial regions in the future:
US East (Ashburn)
US West (Phoenix)
India west (Mumbai)
Switzerland North (Zurich)
Brazil East (Sao Paulo)
Canada Southeast (Montreal)
Australia southeast (Melbourne)

How to Achieve Crypto-Secure Data Management
Maria Colgan | March 3, 2021 | 4 minute read
Distinguished Product Manager
The primary focus of conventional data security technologies like passwords, firewalls, and data encryption is to keep criminals out of your company and your data stores.
But what protects your data, especially your essential assets (contracts, property titles, account statements, etc.), from being modified or even deleted by folks who gain access to your systems legitimately or illegitimately (hackers)?
Crypto-Secure Data Management
This is where Blockchain can help. Layering Blockchain technologies on top of conventional data security features provides an extra level of protection that prevents illicit modifications or deletes of data.
  What is Blockchain?
When we think of Blockchain, many of us instantly think of decentralized peer to peer apps that only permit consensus-based data changes. However, adopting these apps requires new development methodologies, speciality data stores and potentially new business practices, which is complicated and expensive!
But, if we take a closer look at Blockchain technologies, we see four critical components; immutability, cryptographic digests, cryptographic signatures, and distributed systems. Each part works to protect against a different aspect of illicit data changes performed using legitimate user credentials or by hackers.
Integrating these Blockchain technologies into the Oracle Database brings the critical security benefits of Blockchain to mainstream applications with minimal or no changes required. Providing the full functionality of the world’s leading database on crypto-protected data.
Blockchain the Oracle Database
In the video below, Juan Loaiza explains how Oracle implemented Blockchain technologies in the Oracle Database and how you can use them to protect your essential business data.
How Blockchain technologies work in the Oracle Database
To protect against illicit data changes made by rogue insiders or malicious actors using insiders' credentials, Oracle has introduced Immutable tables (insert-only tables) in Oracle Database 21c (21.3) and Oracle Database 19c (19.11).
Immutable tables
With an Immutable table, it is possible to insert new data, but existing data cannot be changed or deleted by anyone using the database, even the database administrators (SYSDBA). It is also impossible to change an immutable table's definition or convert it to an updatable table. However, an Immutable table appears like any other table in the database from an application's point of view. It can store both relational data and JSON documents, and it can be indexed and partitioned or used as the basis of a view.
Blockchain tables
To protect against illicit changes made by hackers, Oracle has introduced Blockchain tables. Blockchain tables are immutable tables that organize rows into several chains. Each row, except the first row in the chain, is chained to the previous row via a cryptographic digest or hash. The hash is automatically calculated on insert based on that row's data and the hash value of the previous row in the chain. Timestamps are also recorded for each row on insertion.
Any modification to data in a Blockchain table breaks the cryptographic chain because the hash value of the row will change.
You can verify the contents of a blockchain table have not been modified since they were inserted using the DBMS_BLOCKCHAIN_TABLE.VERIFY_ROWS procedure.
End-User Data Signing
Even with Immutable or Blockchain tables, data can be falsely inserted in an end user's name by someone using stolen credentials. To address this vulnerability, Oracle allows end-users to cryptographically sign the data they insert using their private key that is never passed to the database. Each end-user registers a digital certificate containing their public key with this database. This digital certificate allows the database to validate the end-users signature when new data is inserted. Even if a hacker manages to steal a valid set of credentials without the private key, the signature on the newly inserted data won't match and will therefore not be accepted.
It's also possible for end-users to ensure the database has received their changes by requesting Oracle countersign the newly inserted data. Oracle returns a crypto-receipt to the user, ensuring nothing on the mid-tier can filter specific data to prevent it from being recorded.
Distribution of Cryptographic Digest
Even with cryptographically chained rows, sophisticated cyber-criminals or authorities could illicitly change data via a large-scale cover-up, where the entire database is replaced. To detect such a cover-up, Oracle enables schema owners to sign and distribute the cryptographic digest for a blockchain table periodically.
Remember, the digest can’t be used to infer the data in the table, but authorized users can use it to validate the chain and confirm their newly inserted data is present. The crypto-digest can be posted to an independent public store or blockchain, like Ethereum or sent out by email or made available via a REST API.
A cover-up can easily be detected by comparing the previously published digests to the current table content. Also, distributing them publicly across multiple independent services prevents an authority or cyber-attacker from deleting all the separate copies.
Getting Started With Blockchain
Both Immutable and Blockchain tables are free features of the Oracle Database. No additional licenses or software is needed to take advantage of these new table types, which are completely transparent to all new and existing applications.
Also, note Oracle has backported Immutable tables and Blockchain tables to Oracle Database 19c (19.11 and 19.10, respectively).
For more information on Blockchain, check out the Oracle Blockchain blog, Oracle Blockchain LiveLabs or the Oracle Blockchain documentation.

Expanding research infrastructure at Rice University

Vice President, Oracle for Research
OpenNebula now interfaces with Oracle Cloud
It always surprises me when researchers say, “wait…Oracle has a Cloud?”
In fact, we do – a very robust and secure cloud with High-Performance Computing (HPC), fast networking, Autonomous Database, and more.  Through Oracle for Research, researchers get both free access to Oracle Cloud and free technical collaboration to optimize the use of cloud to accelerate their research. Through Oracle for Research, I’ve had the great pleasure of working with Klara Jelinkova, CIO, and her wonderful team at Rice University.
Rice is leading the expansion of research in Houston, sparking innovation and growing national visibility and computational capacity.  When Klara applied for a 2-year National Science Foundation (NSF) infrastructure grant to expand Rice’s HPC capacity for research, I was thrilled she invited Oracle for Research to collaborate with her. Under the grant, Rice would build out its on-premises data center, develop infrastructure to burst into a commercial cloud when needed, and share 20% of this goodness with the Open Science Group to advance research across the U.S. At Oracle, we were eager to advance her vision and the research mission at Rice, and supporting the NSF grant application to expand computational capacity was a natural fit.  If awarded, we anticipated a close collaboration, with teams from Rice and Oracle working side by side.
This was 6 months B.C. (Before COVID).  By the time Rice learned it had been awarded the grant, the world was in lockdown. Like everything else, our collaboration went virtual.  We kicked off the project via Zoom in October, 2020, with the overarching objective of exploring the efficacy of cloud-bursting research workloads from the on-premises HPC cluster into Oracle Cloud.  To explore this, the team had to enable Open Nebula to interface with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).
Bursting from an on-prem environment into a commercial cloud for extra capacity sounds like it should be straightforward – just take the research workload that needs more capacity and move it between environments. In reality, this is a complex technical challenge. Research users, some of whom have little technical knowledge, need to be able to interface with the system to submit their workloads. Research workloads must be organized and prioritized within the on-prem environment. The on-prem environment must determine when and what type of extra capacity is needed, and be able to manage the workloads to optimize use of the cloud capacity. The research workloads that will move to the cloud must be transmitted and processed securely, efficiently and without disruption of the on-prem environment. Research results must be returned to the researcher the same way – securely, efficiently and without disruption of the on-prem environment. And, cloud capacity must automatically be spun up and spun down so research dollars are optimized.
In understanding, this, a project that sounded like it was going to be an easy, one-mile flat loop is suddenly seeming a lot more like climbing Mt. Everest.  In both cases, though, the wisdom of Chinese philosopher Lao-Tzu holds true: a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
At Oracle, our technical teams engage in complex collaborative projects with customers every day. They are experts in simplifying the process through sophisticated project plans, assigning project roles and tasks, organizing cadence calls, and writing and testing code, and communicating in technical shorthand via Slack. Oracle for Research brings these technical collaborations to research teams at no cost.  Working with Erik Engquist, Director, Center for Research Computing, and his team at Rice, Oracle for Research and the OCI team plotted a map of milestones to move us forward, identifying a systems architecture and required capacity, integrating tools like Kubernetes and SlateCI for containerizing and orchestrating research workloads, and connecting and aligning the on-prem architecture with OCI.  The work includes developing and delivering an auto-scalable IaaS GPU enabled Kubernetes solution and the seamless integration of SlateCI with the Oracle Kubernetes Engine. Together, this enables Rice to administer and scale multiple on-premises and OCI Kubernetes clusters from a single interface.
When Oracle for Research engages in research collaborations, we actively look for ways to develop community and help make connections between researchers. We also aim to build reusable images, tools, and documentation that can help researchers across disciplines accelerate their results. Sometimes, we find our way to interesting projects because researchers bring them to us.
That was the case here: we were especially excited about the opportunity to develop the OpenNebula API driver and contribute it to the open source community.  OpenNebula is an open source platform to build and manage customized, enterprise cloud environments, and is used across the Rice University campus to make it easy for students, faculty and researchers to use Rice’s IT infrastructure.  It is a critical component of our collaboration with Rice to help expand their research computing capacity.
“We are delighted that this project with Oracle has enabled Oracle and Rice to contribute this resource back to the OpenNebula community,” said Klara Jelinkova, CIO, Rice University. “The close collaboration between Oracle technical experts and my team has provided learning opportunities and enabled us to explore new and innovative technical solutions.”
The creation and donation of the OpenNebula API is an early and exciting mile marker in the current journey that Oracle and Rice are on together, with many more to come. We are grateful for the ongoing and committed collaboration of our colleagues at Rice.
Oracle for Research is on a mission to support researchers in all aspects of discovery. We’ve made it simple for them to host, store and analyze their data with our cloud infrastructure solutions. Our research customers are changing the world; and we’re proud to help them do it.

Oracle Analytics is named a Visionary in 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms: Here's why
John Hagerty | February 16, 2021 | 3 minute read

We’ve made it to 2021!  If you’re like me, 2020 taught us all a lot about ourselves, dealing with global health challenges, political unrest, and civil strife.  For many, our work lives were also turned upside down.  Yet through the dark times, we saw glimmers of hope and promise as people pulled together, adjusted how they lived and worked, and dedicated 2021 to a better (and different) future.   
Once again, Oracle has been named a Visionary in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms.  We thank our customers and partners who have diligently worked to successfully deploy our world-class analytics solutions to thousands of users in their organizations.  We thank our developer teams for offering customers and prospects a choice—in the cloud (Oracle Analytics Cloud), on-premise (Oracle Analytics Server), and within their application of choice (Oracle Fusion Analytics Warehouse for ERP, HCM, CX, Supply Chain, and NetSuite products).  
An innovative vision, delivered today
BI systems of a few years ago pale in comparison to today’s innovative ABI platforms. 
It’s no longer just about who has the best analyst self-service capabilities.  Now, organizations of all sizes expect actionable insights and accurate self-learning predictive models no matter where the underlying data is.  Data is everywhere and ABI platforms must access data regardless of where it’s stored, not require data to be ingested in order to analyze it. The melding of analytics systems and data science platforms is happening in real time driven by customer demand, augmented analytics and the “citizen” movement where analysts expand their skill sets into what has been specialized areas.   
Oracle Analytics is an end-to-end cloud-first platform that delivers visionary augmented data preparation, visualization, dashboards, storytelling, reporting, data science and mobility options.  
  Build or buy? That is the question

Most companies expect to hand-craft their BI and Analytics solutions on their own. Why? Because that’s been their only option. ABI platforms are fielded as a set of capabilities that are configured to solve business problems. Self-service BI is tailor-made for the build-your-own model.  
With Fusion Analytics Warehouse, customers can deploy pre-built, streamlined analytic applications for key business areas such as ERP and human capital management (HCM). This takes the headache out of sourcing, modeling, and creating key performance indicators(KPIs) and other analytics. Organizations can use what’s delivered, as well as extend it with their own data. It’s “buy and use” as well as “buy and extend”;  and the delivered capabilities are automatically upgraded as new capabilities are made available.  Taking action on these insights closes the loop and further weaves analytics and applications into one cohesive fabric.  
As one customer puts it, “It’s a no-brainer.” We agree. Customer Experience (CX) and Supply Chain content are expected later in 2021.  NetSuite Analytics, built on Oracle’s market-leading small and medium-size business solution, is in customer preview now, bringing a pre-built line of business analytic applications to another market-leading application suite.  
From workgroups to enterprise scale

Analytics often starts solving a specific use case, and it’s usually for a contained workgroup. But can these workgroup solutions really scale to the enterprise?   With governance concerns, many of these workgroup approaches just can’t do it.    With Oracle Analytics, customers can create analytic solutions that scale to tens of thousands of users, leveraging the inherent governance, security, scalability, and trusted enterprise platform design of Oracle Analytics.  
Whether it’s a financial services firm that displaced another ABI platform in favor of Oracle Analytics, or a healthcare organization that is rolling out diversity and inclusion analytics to its entire health system, or a real-estate company that’s using analytics across the globe to optimize investments in leasehold improvements, Oracle Analytics is proven to solve virtually any scenario.

Cloud computing, now well into its second decade, has been nothing short of a revolution in IT. In early days, Gen 1 public cloud providers made it easier and less expensive for startups and small groups of developers at larger organizations to write, test, and deploy new software. 
That was great for developers and other tech-savvy folks, but challenging for companies dependent on complicated enterprise applications, or that wanted the benefits of both public cloud economics for some workloads and the control and compliance-readiness of privately run data centers or private clouds.
The Gen 1 cloud ethos was pretty much: “Send us all your data and applications, we will run them.” And there were extremely limited ways to divvy these workloads up between the cloud and the customers’ own data centers.
That’s not an attractive proposition for companies used to controlling their own tech stacks.
For that reason, many companies went the private cloud route, cobbling together their own clouds with various tools. But then, if they wanted to forge interoperability with a public cloud, it was extremely tricky to link two very different architectures. 
The reality was there was a hard line between private and public cloud that made true “hybrid” cloud impossible.
Fostering real hybrid cloud
The good news is that is changing. A better way to serve these customers is to enable them to run the same IT services on both sides of their corporate firewall—in their own server rooms and in a public cloud. This means they can balance everyday workloads between sites as well as add public cloud resources easily to meet seasonal or unexpected demand spikes, and then quickly move workloads back to their onsite cloud when needs subside, providing true pay-as-you-go price elasticity.
This model also ensures that customers can keep working even if there’s an Internet glitch. The old model required companies to be tethered to Gen 1 cloud mothership all the time: if that connection fails or slows to a crawl, it’s a huge problem.
In a hybrid cloud environment, if there is an Internet outage, companies can run their workloads on the private cloud side and replicate changes and updates back to public cloud instances when network service resumes. (Some workloads may, in fact, run entirely on the private cloud if regulatory compliance requires).
To be sure, Gen 1 cloud providers have taken steps to soften their monolithic “all your work stays with us” mindset, but none of those providers offer the same services to run in customer data centers and the public cloud, which is a requirement of true hybrid cloud.
This means customers that run certain higher-end services in their own data centers or private clouds can’t move workloads between those private environments and Gen 1 public clouds.
Wanted: Locations, locations, locations
The newer cloud deployment model, enables a multinational company with a presence in Germany, for example, to deploy a smaller private cloud in-country to ensure it meets Germany’s strict data sovereignty requirements, while continuing to use public cloud outside Germany for other workloads.
The ability for a company to “stand up” multiple clouds wherever it operates without worrying about whether all workloads will work in every instance is a hybrid cloud model for our time. 
Summing up:
There is no question that Gen 1 public clouds have done much to unlock the creativity and productivity of developers. But the disparate needs for information technology means that no one cloud fits all.
Corporations and government agencies needing to tap into the seemingly infinite resources of public cloud while also cordoning off cloud services for their private use and under their control represent a huge market, and one that true hybrid cloud can serve."

As someone who’s covered databases on and off for—well never mind for how long—I've been struck by the tension between the secure fortress that is the corporate database and the need of normal people to make the most and best use of that data.
That’s one major problem addressed by the new Oracle APEX cloud service. This new managed service can help companies get the most out of their key data by letting mere mortals (as opposed to professional software developers) build applications that make use of that data.
This is the best of both worlds—enabling the fast creation of graphical, easy-to-use apps that bring to the surface important data while allowing the Oracle database to continue managing, analyzing, monitoring, and securing it.
To be fair, APEX is one of those overnight successes that’s actually been around for nearly 20 years. There are now half a million APEX users across 50,000 companies around the world. Not for nothing, but that’s a pretty energized group that newbies can turn to for informal help and support.
So yes, Oracle APEX is a low-code development tool that was around long before the term “low-code development” took the tech world by storm. What’s new here is that Oracle has made APEX more easily and readily available at low cost to people who want to create beautiful-looking data-driven applications but are not necessarily database administrators or programming whizzes.
If, for example, you manage a product line, you have a pretty good idea of pricing or sales or material information that you would like to present to your staff, customers., or partners. With APEX, you can mock-up and produce an application simply by pointing-and-clicking on on-screen modules instead of requesting that a company programmer build it for you—with all the delay and tsouris that causes.
In addition to making the most from information residing in your Oracle databases, you can also incorporate information from remote sources including other SQL, JSON and spatial databases as well as REST-based applications

It’s a simple concept, but one that bears repeating for those who seem to think that one company has a sole claim on cloud computing. Having a choice in cloud providers is a very positive thing.
First and foremost, one provider might be better at dealing with certain types of applications than another. Second, all vendor posturing aside, a smart company can play cloud providers off against each other to get better pricing and more and better features for its own needs. So choice is very good for customers in a number of ways.
Yes, Oracle’s second-generation cloud came out later than competitive clouds, but I would argue—as you might expect—that it was thus able to build on lessons learned from its earlier cloud effort, as well as from cloud rivals.  
Oracle positions Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) as the best cloud to run the gnarly enterprise applications that have powered businesses for years but are difficult to move wholesale from on-premises to the cloud.
It has also parlayed the strengths of Real Application Clustering (RAC) in Oracle Autonomous Database running on OCI to achieve zero downtime during software patches and updates. Minimizing downtime is incredibly important for mission-critical applications and industry analysts agree that only Oracle offers this key capability.
It also looked carefully at cloud pricing overall and figured out it can charge much less for some key cloud services than rivals —data egress from the cloud is one example—and still turn a profit.
Customers are noticing the progress. As noted on Oracle’s second quarter earnings call last Thursday, revenue for OCI (the aforementioned second generation cloud) was up 139% for the quarter. Total cloud services plus license support revenue rose 4% from last year to $7.1 billion.  
That is good news, but OCI infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is just one part of Oracle’s overall cloud story. Oracle leads the world in cloud ERP applications and is growing its HCM and front-office CX businesses as well. The Fusion ERP business – which targets large companies—grew 33% in the quarter to more than 7,500 customers, Oracle CTO Larry Ellison said on the call. And, NetSuite, ERP software favored by small and mid-sized companies, grew 21% to more than 24,000 customers.
So yes, Oracle started later than some cloud providers, but it has made progress building out its cloud business to attract not only long-time database-and-applications customers, but brand new clients wanting to take advantage of modern cloud infrastructure and lower pricing on key services as well.
As Nucleus Research analyst Trevor White told SiliconAngle recently: “Net new deals both to [Oracle's] IaaS and enterprise application segments over the last year underpin the strong results [for the quarter.]”"

A few things I believe we’ll see happen in 2021
(By Jason Williamson, Global Head and VP of Oracle for Startups and Oracle for Research. Originally published in Chief Executive.)
We learn so much from the founders, creators and innovators we have the pleasure to work with in our Oracle for Startups and Oracle for Research programs. Having a front-row view into the world of startup and research innovation ecosystems provides a wealth of insights and learnings. In a highly unpredictable 2020, we got a few guesses right with last year’s predictions piece. Here are things I believe we’ll see happen in 2021.
Voice innovation booms as the future of customer engagements
Voice-enabled technologies will boom with innovation advancements and adoption. COVID was an accelerant, but customers and employees will increasingly come to expect it. According to a Capgemini Research report, more than 77% of customers expect to interact with “touchless” interfaces like voice assistants. And companies are increasing their resources to meet those demands.
AI-powered startups are playing a big role in this revolution. Loud Voice Services is a Cannes Lions award-winning startup using its AI platform to handle customer service engagements through voice, saving customers up to 70% in costs. DeepZen creates ultra-realistic emotional and expressive human voice offerings with its unique AI solution. The startup helps industries like media and publishing cut the production of audio books from weeks to hours — saving time and money. Cloud, AI and startup ingenuity are driving these voice solutions. 2021 will see a big spike — both with innovation and adoption.
Food insecurity inspires innovation and partnerships to increase
Food insecurity and hunger aren’t new issues. But just like everything else, they’ve been accelerated because of COVID. Due to pandemic shut-downs, social distancing and job losses, 50 million new people have entered into poverty conditions and food insecurity in 2020. And those numbers are conservative. In our increasingly virtual world, with less quality food easily available, the numbers will only increase. But there’s hope.
I think 2021 will see ingenuity and strategic partnerships sprout due to the fast-rising need, human awareness and compassion. The private sector will join forces with the government to see the beginnings of change. Companies like Whole Foods, Walmart, Uber and others will partner with innovative founders and builders to provide solutions that can be boosted by our government. We are seeing it with the innovators and researchers we work with at Oracle for Startups and Oracle for Research. In fact, I believe our programs will see a 20% increase in technologies trying to solve for food insecurity and food sustainability.
Middle East innovation drives global business growth
The agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will unleash innovation and business opportunities not just for these unique ecosystems but worldwide. Israel is the Startup Nation, but the UAE has been earning its own technology and entrepreneurial chops. Look for benefits to go both ways. Israel gets access to the UAE’s investors and the ability to collaborate on tech, and vice-versa. While Israel has traditionally focused on the United States and Europe, the UAE has ties to the east and can help open opportunity to new markets like Malaysia, Indonesia and Pakistan.
Israeli startups are known as pioneers. Leading in agritech, AgroScout’s AI drone platform is boosting crop production and food sustainability. We’re also seeing sharp increases across the Middle East with innovators like Awini App (Riyadh), Reengen (Istanbul), and Mawlny (Jeddah). Growth from startups joining our program from the Middle East is up 297% YoY. Their collective innovation will unlock and unleash new business opportunities across the globe.
Construction and engineering industry steps up with innovation
It might not be the most glamorous industry, but it’s ripe for disruption. We’re seeing it with many startups that are using Oracle Cloud and integrating with Oracle’s construction and engineering products. ATLAS, a complete digital solution for healthcare construction, is making sustainable, cost-effective and scalable facilities available to improve global healthcare access. German-based ConcR uses IoT and sensors to provide real-time quality and insights about concrete — making “dumb concrete smart.” And Reconstruct uses its 3D visual platform to make remote construction monitoring possible.
Whether it’s innovations in brand-new construction, or rethinking and optimizing building space for a new remote-working world, this industry will see massive innovation this year. The United States saw a slowdown within the supply chain for construction, but an increase in demand for new building and home improvement. The industry will remain strong through 2021 and will create areas of innovation opportunities as people need to collaborate, design and execute on projects.
High-performance computing no longer just for big companies and researchers
Cloud-based high-performance computing (HPC) capacity is allowing even small startups to compete with established players in fields that require storage, processing, and analysis of massive amounts of data. Think biomedical research, video streaming, AI analysis, and advanced engineering. Data volumes are exploding. The global datasphere will grow from 35 zettabytes in 2020 to 175 zettabytes by 2025, according to IDC. That’s an incomprehensible 1 + 21 zeros. Consider that nearly 30% (and growing every year) of that data requires real-time processing, and you understand why startups are claiming their place at the HPC table.
The number of AI, machine learning, and big data companies enrolling in our Oracle for Startups program has grown more than 20% this year. Among them, AI and analytics startup Kinetica is tapping Oracle Cloud HPC capacity to analyze huge datasets, including drone data collected on the San Francisco Bay to combat pollution.
Sound board governance and board integrity returns
The board of directors is one of the most integral parts of a startup’s internal management structure. These individuals have great responsibilities, including fiduciary and ethical duties, to act in the best interest of the company. It’s an honor and a privilege that requires dedication, discipline and integrity. Unfortunately, the role has also become lax in today’s capital-flushed investing world where seemingly anyone with a checkbook can qualify as a board member. And even some seasoned venture capitalists have come into question.
We’ve seen many epic fails where sound board governance didn’t prevail. But it is happening with lower profile startups, and it can greatly harm innovation for the startup and the ecosystem. Growth-at-all-costs mantra is a failed experiment. Yes, more money can help build a competitive moat, but it can also lead to blind spots and stupidity. Sound business principles and fiscal responsibility will make a return. That starts with board members leading with integrity. I alluded to this in last year’s predictions. So, pardon my wishful thinking for this year.
Multicloud is the future — 2021 will see advanced adoption
Today’s cloud technologies are becoming increasingly more commoditized and portable. And while cloud providers are showing their strengths (think Oracle and HPC), the strategy of using multiple cloud providers is the future. Think of recent outages that have taken down a big chunk of the internet and many businesses. With a multicloud strategy, these businesses could have shifted resources to another infrastructure provider and not missed a beat.
Public clouds have tremendous benefits — but lock-in should never be one of them. Price-performance, interoperability and security will drive your partner selections.

What’s another word for volunteering? In this series, we’re asking nonprofit organizations to make up words that describe what Oracle Volunteers' contributions mean to them.
Think back to your days as a student. What did it take to get to school? Whether by car, bus, subway, or other means, we can all remember our morning routines to get to class.
In India, going to school can look many different ways. Students in urban areas head to class via public transport or bikes. For others, school is a rickshaw ride away. In rural areas, students may traverse miles of countryside on foot or even ride small river boats to school. Sometimes, the classroom takes an unexpected shape — that of a desert tent or a converted bus.
Amidst the pandemic and countrywide school closures, these daily journeys stopped, and millions of children needed to “go to school” differently. Students and educators alike needed to be scrappy—think imaginatively, channel their creativity, and act resourcefully.
Lisa Heydlauff, founder of India-based nonprofit, Going to School, has dedicated her career to enriching children’s lives through education. The organization uses storytelling to teach young people entrepreneurial skills using books, mobile applications, radio, and video. With these resources on hand, she swiftly thought up a solution to keep students learning during the pandemic: School TV.
“When schools closed in March, we knew the children we usually reached were not online and they’d not be able to get online to learn,” says Lisa. “However, we also knew that most households, even in remote rural communities, have a television. So, we called the Government of Bihar and suggested School TV. They’d already bought hours of TV airtime every day for the year, so it was a perfect match.”
School TV would feature lessons on a variety of topics to be broadcast on Doordarshan, the country’s national television station. To bring School TV to life, Lisa enlisted the help of Oracle Volunteers. Using their laptops and mobile devices, 30 volunteers sprang into action—producing lessons on coding, math, music, drawing, physical fitness, botany, at-home science experiments, and more. 
“Another word for volunteering is bescrappy. At Going to School, to be scrappy means changing the world for the better, using whatever you have, wherever you are. School TV was made possible by Oracle Volunteers embracing this idea and demonstrating how a little bit of ingenuity goes a long way.” 
Lisa Heydlauff, Founder, Going to School
For Nisha, a tenth-grade student in Bihar, School TV served as a learning lifeline. “When my local coaching center shut down, I feared this would mean the end of my education, and, in a way, my childhood,” recalls Nisha. “My face lit up when my brother turned on the news and I learned that school would continue through the TV.”
For fourth-grader, Badal, online learning wasn’t an option, but fortunately one of his uncles lived in a neighborhood with a community TV. Badal started visiting and tuning in for lessons. Lalita, who normally goes to a government school, felt uncertain about her education after her workbooks were destroyed by rain. Thanks to School TV, Lalita has learned about topics like art, yoga, and entrepreneurship from home.
Since premiering in May 2020, School TV has reached over one million students in Bihar alone. The program will air through March 2021, and Oracle Volunteers have already started producing lessons for School TV’s expansion to Maharashtra and Rajasthan to reach even more students like Nisha, Badal, and Lalita.
“These kids are the next generation of India and the world,” shared Oracle Volunteer Mitali Sengupta. “If I can impart even one good habit in them, then I will be proud of myself and the School TV project will stay with me forever.”
“Another word for volunteering is bescrappy,” says Lisa. “At Going to School, to be scrappy means changing the world for the better, using whatever you have, wherever you are. School TV was made possible by Oracle Volunteers embracing this idea and demonstrating how a little bit of ingenuity goes a long way.”

New report ranks Oracle as overall leader in enterprise cloud databases
Jeffrey Erickson | November 3, 2020 | 4 minute read
Director of tech content
A report published by KuppingerCole Analysts AG, Leadership Compass: Enterprise Databases in the Cloud, ranks Oracle Autonomous Database as the overall leader versus Amazon and Microsoft with leadership positions in cloud database products and technology, and cloud database innovation. In ranking Oracle as the overall leader, analysts at KuppingerCole rate Oracle’s cloud database offerings with a “strong positive” in security, functionality, deployment, interoperability, and usability.
“Oracle has been continuously developing numerous innovative database capabilities for decades,” notes lead author Alexei Balaganski, giving one of the reasons for Autonomous Database’s ranking as “overall leader” in enterprise cloud database.
Decades of innovation by Oracle product management and development teams—a process of day-in and day-out work on their customers’ most challenging use cases—has enabled Oracle to bring deep capabilities into the cloud and automate them on its second-generation cloud infrastructure.
KuppingerCole’s annual Leadership Compass report provides an overview of enterprise databases for modern, cloud native application architectures as well as data processing and analytics at scale.
The advantage of Oracle’s single multimodel converged database 
Citing the increased volumes and complexity of information that ends up being stored in the cloud, the report lauds Oracle’s unique ability to keep it simple for cloud customers: 
“With over 40 years of expertise, the company is arguably the leading solution provider for enterprise transaction processing, data warehousing, and mixed database workloads. The core technology that provides the common foundation for Oracle’s entire database services portfolio is Oracle Database, a multimodel database management system that combines a traditional relational database with NoSQL data models like JSON, key-value, and even HDFS file formats.
The report describes how Oracle has all its capabilities available in a single, multimodel database, running on highly optimized hardware, “powered by intelligent automation eliminating the human factor from database management—this is the kind of innovation customers are looking for in a cloud database.”  By contrast, Amazon offers no similar multimodel database.  In its analysis of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the report states, “… currently, AWS has a portfolio of 15 specialized fully managed database services.” 
  Product Leaders are based on ""the functional strength of the vendors’ solutions,"" says the report.
KuppingerCole believes the multimodel approach “offers more long-term benefits for customers, including significantly lower learning curve for developers, more flexibility in changing data models mid-development, and availability of all project data in one place without creating multiple data silos. A major downside of the other, tool-focused approach is, of course, the increased difficulty of consistent data management and analytics across several incompatible database engines, which has to be compensated with additional tools or services.”
 
Complementing all of this, according to the report, is Oracle’s “security by design” approach, which brings data protection and privacy controls into every layer of the company’s cloud infrastructure. Combined with “highly competitive cloud service pricing, this makes Oracle Cloud a compelling alternative to its more established competitors, especially for enterprises operating in highly regulated industries or having massive egress traffic requirements,” the report says.
Cloud innovation: Oracle Autonomous Database 
Citing Oracle’s decades-long pursuit of database innovation, the report singles out Oracle’s autonomous database, which, eliminates human labor and human error with automated provisioning, upgrades, backup, and disaster recovery with no downtime.
Introduced in 2018, Oracle Autonomous Database uses machine learning and automation to perform DBA tasks without human intervention, “not just substantially increasing security and compliance of sensitive data stored in Oracle databases, but also noticeably reducing operational costs in the cloud,” notes the report. 
  Oracle offers, ""the kind of innovation customers are looking for in a cloud database,"" says the report.
“Since 2020, Autonomous Database services are available on-premises as well (or even as a part of Oracle Dedicated Region with over 50 managed services), delivering a truly unified ‘hybrid-native’ platform for managing enterprise data at the cloud scale, while retaining the level of security and compliance previously available on-premises only.”
The report offers this outlook for Oracle’s future as a cloud service provider (CSP): 
“…Oracle Cloud is currently growing at an impressive rate, planning to surpass all other major CSPs by 2021. Co-managed and autonomous database services are a major part of the company’s cloud strategy, making Oracle Database available in a public cloud or in a Cloud@Customer private cloud format, either on commodity hardware or on highly optimized Exadata infrastructure.”

The SAP/Siemens PLM Partnership: Two Questions SAP Customers Should Ask
Guest Author | October 2, 2020 | 5 minute read
By Jon Chorley, Chief Sustainability Officer and GVP, Supply Chain Management Product Strategy, Oracle
When SAP and Siemens announced that they would partner to provide integrated, end-to-end applications across product lifecycle management (PLM), supply chain, and asset management, I had a lot of questions. I’m sure SAP customers do as well.
With this partnership, SAP will offer Siemens’ Teamcenter PLM software and Siemens will offer some of SAP’s supply chain and asset management applications, following the theory that bringing multiple legacy systems together will magically provide a modern approach for customers.
SAP and Siemens were correct in determining what the market needs and wants. Companies are looking for a way to accelerate product innovation and link it more effectively into all aspects of business operations, including supply chain and manufacturing. They also want to use the latest technologies to enable rapid prototyping, faster time-to-market, and new business models such as subscription services.
However, with SAP’s spotty track record on integrating applications, I would say that SAP and Siemens customers have cause for concern. Even SAP’s Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Hasso Plattner, acknowledged the company’s failure to integrate its own applications in an interview earlier this year with Handelsblatt, a leading German-language business newspaper:
“We bought some companies just because they had a nicer user interface. But that’s not enough… When you ask major SAP customers, you always hear the same thing: ‘You have to bring the services into line!’ Oracle has done that. The idea of simply letting every company run independently and autonomously may even have made sense from a business viewpoint… Yet technologically, we didn’t make the right decision. That cost us a year and a half to two years, but mentally the toll was a lot more.”
    Given that history—and the importance of integrating product development with the supply chain and other functions—here are two questions that customers might want to ask SAP about this partnership:
Given that SAP has consistently demonstrated an inability to effectively integrate technologies of companies it actually acquires, why should I expect a partnership with an independent and equivalently established company to be any different?
As Plattner admitted, SAP has not driven any kind of integration across its own technologies and its acquired applications. If SAP can’t integrate technologies it’s acquired, like SuccessFactors and Ariba, how successful will it be when working with a separate company that has its own agenda and objectives?
Oracle has always viewed product lifecycle management as an extension of the supply chain. We've worked diligently to break down the process rules between engineering, design, and the supply chain, and we have built a unified, end-to-end system specifically for the cloud, with a common tech stack and data model.
The Siemens PLM application is a good product but it was not built for the cloud – and then SAP will attempt to integrate it with its own set of older products, also not built for the cloud. How will that work – and how will it benefit customers? It’s very unclear.
And if these companies can come to a common agreement on how to rebuild these technologies for the cloud, they will have to overcome not only technical issues on the product development side but also the challenge of aligning two organizations, two boards of directors, and two sales teams.
Although I’m certainly glad that it’s endorsing Oracle’s strategy, history tells us that SAP won’t be able to execute.
Siemens PLM is old and was not built for the Cloud. What will the next generation of Siemens PLM look like, and how can I be assured that it will work effectively with whatever SAP eventually delivers in the cloud?
While SAP and Siemens may think they’re going to deliver an integrated approach, I sense that much of their focus might be on easier-to-deliver bells and whistles – perhaps a digital simulation, 3D printing, rapid prototyping – but not on the true PLM and supply chain integration that companies need.
This is critical because competition no longer takes place just between products; increasingly, products are offered as a service. It’s essential that a company’s PLM technology is tied into its sourcing and manufacturing as well as its finance systems, so new business models can be explored. And if a company offers its product on a subscription basis, asset management and maintenance are also critical.
All of these aspects of the supply chain and back office need to be well connected if you want to accelerate your launch cycle. Companies need to understand how product innovations affect their supply chain, how they’re going to start gearing up, what the potential demand picture for new products looks like, and how all of that links into a coherent new product introduction process.
With Oracle Cloud Applications, all of these processes are natively integrated and leverage machine learning technologies. It's hard to see how that's going to happen with SAP and Siemens; there are likely to be islands of development, with some owned by SAP and some owned by Siemens, and thin bridges between and among them. Without tightly integrated product development and management among the various teams of both companies, its really difficult to see how they will be able to deliver on the promise they’re making to customers.
As Oracle’s chief sustainability officer, I can’t help but look at this announcement from an environmental perspective as well. Obviously, product design has a part to play in the production of hazardous materials, controlling waste, improving energy efficiency, and more.  
A strong, integrated PLM solution with intelligence built in enables design teams to make smart environmental choices over the full lifecycle, from sourcing through distribution. This is among the factors that companies need to consider when looking at modernizing their product development processes.
The bottom line
Speeding innovation and time-to-market has never been more important. And as this tumultuous year has shown us, companies that have integrated systems and processes are better able to innovate quickly. Whether that becomes the case in this SAP/Siemens partnership remains to be seen – but if past history and their intrinsic cultures are anything to go by, the outlook does not look good. Partnerships like this are like ships passing in the night. Good for an exchange of signals but with no lasting engagement. 
In contrast, building to this vision has been Oracle’s focus for years. We have taken the hard road and not the expedient one. We now have customers all over the world that are using our integrated applications to innovate faster, adapt operations to meet rapidly changing markets, plan effectively, and build sustainable supply chain operations.

Introducing the Supply Chain Visionaries of 2020
Guest Author | September 30, 2020 | 3 minute read
By Rick Jewell, Senior Vice President, Applications Development, Oracle
One of the most rewarding parts of my job is witnessing first-hand the groundbreaking work our customers are doing with the help of our cloud technologies. The last six months have stretched supply chain professionals to their limit as they respond to unimaginable disruptions, but we’ve seen many of our customers rise to this challenge, adapt operations, and pivot to sustained growth.
Today, I’m honored to recognize outstanding supply chain leaders in the 2020 edition of the Oracle Supply Chain Management (SCM) Excellence Awards.
This year’s award winners have successfully adapted their organizations’ supply chain strategies to build resilience while driving business growth—and they’ve managed to achieve this during undoubtedly the most challenging year ever for supply chain professionals.
After carefully evaluating a wide variety of remarkable nominations, I’m pleased to announce that Cohu, GE Power, Western Digital, and Precision Group UAE are the 2020 Oracle SCM Excellence Awards winners. These visionaries have embraced innovation and agility to build highly adaptable and resilient supply chains:  
Craig Halterman, Chief Information Officer, Cohu
Under Craig’s leadership, Cohu decided to go “all-in” on Oracle Cloud. His goal was to harmonize business processes with a focus on program governance and an emphasis on delivering business driven capabilities. Now, with Cohu’s standardized systems, a smaller, more nimble IT staff can maintain the systems while supporting the company’s growing business and future acquisitions.
Pravin Kamble, Senior Director of Supply Chain IT, GE Power
At GE Power, Pravin’s exemplary leadership and vision enabled his supply chain team to overcome existing challenges by creating a global process and unifying their platform at the supply chain level. They’ve built a robust supply chain that is already seeing significant improvement and will drive topline and bottom line growth and efficiency with Oracle’s cloud-based supply chain solutions.
Matthew Smith, Senior Director of Global Transportation and Trade Operations, Western Digital
Matthew saw the opportunity to streamline Western Digital’s global logistics team by leveraging a central control tower concept to manage all worldwide logistics from a single office. His efforts have been crucial to driving change management and cost savings across the entire organization, yielding hard dollar savings through consolidation and advanced planning.
Praveen Hebalallu, Head of Supply Chain, Precision Group UAE
After running on a legacy system for more than 25 years, Praveen and team’s vision for the future was cloud. From day one, they were able to see analytics that used to take them months to get right. With their immediate success in hand, they are now looking to incorporate emerging tech to create a smart factory and automate their shop floor, maintaining the company’s status as a technology-driven organization while increasing their market competitiveness.
These industry experts have positioned their organizations for success today and far into the future. They’ve enhanced agility, boosted innovation, driven new business models, and created breakthrough experiences for customers, employees, partners, and suppliers.
Supply chain management has become a key driver of business strategy for organizations across all industries and I’m looking forward to continuing our partnership with these visionaries as they meet and overcome the challenges ahead – while delivering stellar customer experiences and fostering business growth. Congratulations to these very deserving winners of the 2020 Oracle SCM Excellence Awards!

Oracle Extends its Cloud CX Ecosystem
Stephen Fioretti | September 29, 2020 | 3 minute read
VP, Strategic Software Partnerships, Oracle Advertising and CX
In March, Merriam-Webster made the fastest update in its history. In just seven days, the term “COVID-19” – along with others that have become common in our dialogue such as “social distancing” and “contact tracing” –  became a defined word in the English language and gave us guidance to refer to what our world was facing.
In the business world, the term “stay-at-home stock” is also new. Wall Street and everyday investors are betting on companies and technologies that are enabling our daily lives. Examples of these so-called “stay-at-home stocks” include home-office companies that help employees connect and collaborate while offices are closed, and consumer tech and fitness companies that entertain us as gyms, movie theaters, and recreational businesses shuttered worldwide.
These stocks largely advanced because they helped businesses meet a new set of customer demands, and I’m proud to say several of our ISV partners are at the forefront of accelerating these changes.
Zoom: As our founder and CTO Larry Ellison recently said in our earnings call, Zoom has become one of the fastest-growing companies – and the company name is already being used as a verb. Surely Zoom needs no explanation, as its service has penetrated both our professional and personal lives as we seek new ways to engage with colleagues and family. Today we announced new integrations between Oracle Fusion Cloud Customer Experience and Zoom that help sales, marketing, and customer service teams seamlessly incorporate video and collaboration tools into existing processes and workflows, in order to make every customer interaction matter.
Sprinklr: It’s tougher than ever for brands to convert online customer interactions to sales. A recent Accenture survey found 50 percent of people are frustrated with a recent buying experience, and according to a Baymard Institute study, 69 percent of online shopping carts are abandoned. In order to build brand loyalty, organizations have to make every customer interaction matter and meet them where they are, when they are there. Sprinklr helps organizations reach, engage, and listen to customers across 23 social channels, 11 messaging channels, and SMS, in addition to blogs, forums, and review sites. With Sprinklr, we announced new integrations with Oracle Fusion Cloud CX to help marketers reach audiences on social media and other messaging channels at any point in the customer journey, and help customer service professionals resolve service requests more efficiently.
At Oracle, we are also working to enable the next generation of business with our customer data management platform (CDP) – or as we like to call it, a customer intelligence platform, Oracle Unity. The more information customers can have at their fingertips, the more informed decisions they can make that are best for their businesses.
We introduced several updates to Oracle Unity to help predict and personalize customer interactions, eliminate customer blind spots, and enhance compliance and time-to-value. As a part of this effort, we have also collaborated with leading companies to integrate with Oracle Unity and help our mutual customers optimize the B2B experience.
SourcePoint, a leader in establishing consumer consent and choice as the new standards for all digital experiences, has integrated its Consent Management Platform with Oracle Unity. This will help our mutual customers maintain consent records that are quickly and easily accessible in real time.
OneTrust, one of the most widely-used consent and preferences technology platforms, will integrate with Oracle Unity to help customers achieve privacy compliance goals. It does this by enriching end user profile data with opt-ins, cookie consent, communication preferences and more, to help ensure customer choices are honored throughout marketing systems.
I’m proud to lead the team that is dedicated to developing partnerships with companies that are charting new paths and helping brands adapt to rapid change. We know we are better together in delivering solutions and value to our customers. As our Oracle Fusion Cloud CX ecosystem continues to see remarkable growth, we hope to help customers grow alongside us, as they create memorable customer experiences across every touchpoint, every time.

Time Equals Money: Moat Outcomes Gives Advertisers Fast and Actionable Measurement of Real-World Business Results
Kevin Whitcher | September 23, 2020 | 2 minute read
What if your thermometer only gave you a reading two days after you took it? Or your car’s gas gauge showed the fuel level from a week earlier?
You would make ill-informed – and even counter-productive – decisions because that information was outdated and no longer relevant to your current situation. That’s because measurement is only actionable when it’s timely.
The same holds true in advertising. Too often, measurement of the impact of campaigns has lagged well behind the campaigns themselves, as data on key business outcomes like sales lift and Return on Investment (ROI) are not available until many weeks or months after the ads have run. Rather than adjusting and improving a campaign in-flight to drive better business results, advertisers are forced to make-do with slow, out of date results that don’t keep pace with the demands of running a business.
To address this industry-wide challenge around timeliness, we are delighted to expand our Moat by Oracle Data Cloud measurement suite to include Moat Outcomes, an always-on platform that will change the measurement game.
With Moat Outcomes, causal measurement becomes more agile and responsive, providing marketers with real-world business results from their ad campaign in as little as ten days. Using a new dynamic UI, marketers or their agency partners can quickly evaluate and improve all of their campaigns on a tactical level by comparing results across different audiences, creatives, or placements, so they can pull the right levers to meaningfully improve performance while the campaign is still running. For the budget-constrained marketer, the rapid reallocation of resources to the most effective channels and tactics can save both time and money.
Moat Outcomes equips marketers with a toolkit to measure sales lift, whether CPG, retail, or restaurant. For big box retail or QSR advertisers, the ability to measure total store sales for their clients – aggregated and broken out by retail vs. online purchase – is powered by Oracle Data Cloud’s collaboration with Visa.
By integrating location data from PlaceIQ, Moat Outcomes also helps marketers measure whether their digital ads are driving a lift in brick-and-mortar visits to stores, restaurants, auto dealerships, and many other physical locations. With this collaboration, our measurement solution expands to serve an even broader set of advertisers, including auto and media & entertainment, to whom location-based outcomes prove critical in affecting ROI.
""PlaceIQ is excited to deepen our collaboration with Oracle in this launch, combining our best-in-class data set with their trusted methodology to enable marketers to manage foot traffic KPIs,” said Duncan McCall, CEO of PlaceIQ. “The capability to connect physical and digital signals comes at a time when marketers need it most - not just to monitor foot traffic, but to actually optimize mid-campaign and actively drive ROI for their business.""
In an era of constrained budgets and constant changes in consumer behavior, marketers can’t afford to wait for belated retrospective measurement studies. Moat Outcomes helps marketers identify timely adjustments to improve their campaign performance based on measurable business results. Put simply, if your marketing machine is a sports car, don’t you want to be sure it has the gas it needs to roar?

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure: Compute and High-Performance Computing Roadmap Update
Karan Batta | September 22, 2020 | 6 minute read
Vice President, Product
Today, I wanted to share some important news on Oracle’s compute infrastructure offerings. Listening to our customers about their requirements and experiences, we found that the promise of high-performance computing (HPC) and performance in the public cloud still comes with too many trade-offs, caveats, and gaps.
So, we have updates both to our current capabilities and news related to our Compute services roadmap. These announcements are designed to meet the high expectations our infrastructure customers, including for HPC solutions to deliver the best of both worlds: the absolute performance they expect from on-premises systems and the pay-per-use, flexibility, and scalability of cloud, all at a leading price point.
Doubling Down on Future High-Performance Computing Investments with Intel
Our existing portfolio of HPC capabilities is best-in-class and more comparable to on-premises purpose-built clusters. Services from other cloud providers have underserved this market. Over the last year, we’ve invested in this arena to provide customers with the benefits of both on-premises and cloud with none of the downsides, such as overbuilding to peak capacity.
And customers have responded. Our recent announcement with Nissan Motors in Japan is a great example, where Nissan moved to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for its Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), crash simulations, and 3D visualization workloads. Altair Engineering announced today that they’re betting on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as their preferred provider for internal use and for customer-facing SaaS products.
“Our goal is to help customers solve complex problems faster, easier, and smarter than ever before,” said Sam Mahalingam, CTO of Altair. “We’ve standardized on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, because it delivers the best price-performance, enabling our customers to easily design innovative sustainable products.”
As part of our HPC platform roadmap, we’re collaborating closely with Intel, and we’re excited to announce that early next year, we’re offering our next generation HPC Compute instances based on Intel’s Ice Lake processors. Workloads such as crash simulations, CFD, and Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workloads are expected to deliver more than 30 percent more performance compared to our existing X7 HPC generation of instances. Customers can also deploy these instances as bare metal, get NVMe storage for local check-pointing, a balanced core-memory ratio, and ability to build clusters of these instances on our remote direct memory access (RDMA)-enabled cluster network. Finally, to feed all this computing, you can also build large distributed storage clusters running high-performance file systems, and we've built a highly scalable file system to serve this purpose. The recent IO500 shows that Oracle has the fastest, cloud-based BeeGFS cluster in the world.
  Put simply, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has and continues to have the best cloud HPC platform.
NVIDIA A100 General Availability
Continuing our investments in HPC, our existing set of NVIDIA GPU offerings is best-in-class within the public cloud space. In fact, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s current NVIDIA GPU infrastructure is more comparable to on-premises systems, such as NVIDIA’s DGX, as a great alternative for customers that need the absolute best performance for their workloads, such as deep learning training or hardware accelerated visualizations.
We announced earlier this year that Oracle is working with NVIDIA on the next generation of GPU instances in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Today we’re announcing general availability of those instances starting September 30 in our US, EMEA, and JAPAC regions, at an industry low on-demand price of $3.05 per GPU per hour. This bare metal instance joins our cluster network architecture, allowing customers to scale up to 512 GPUs in a single cluster for large-scale artificial intelligence training or HPC workloads.
These instances provide up to 1.6 Tb per second of bandwidth per bare-metal node that houses eight A100 GPUs, all fully interconnected with NVLINK. These instances also provide you with over 25 Tb of local NVMe storage and 2 Tb of RAM for large-scale graph workloads or accelerated databases. Finally, we also allow for cutting edge capabilities such as GPUDirect through RDMA, not yet available on any other cloud provider. Furthermore, you can use all the existing toolsets, preconfigured Data Science virtual machines, and Marketplace images, along with support for NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC). We’ve been working with several customers in preview over the last few months, including DeepZen, IdenTV, and Altair.
“Replicating the human voice with AI is highly dependent on processing power, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure delivers that with the new NVIDIA A100 GPU, which provided an immediate performance increase of 37% enabling us to scale our business.” Kerem Sozugecer, Co-Founder and CTO and Deep Zen Limited.
“The amount of streaming video data being created is growing exponentially. To deliver real-time analytics and insights demands the highest level of graphics processing units. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure delivers that with the new NVIDIA A100 GPU where we expect an immediate performance gain of 35%.” Amro Shihadah, Cofounder and COO of IDenTV.
One thing is clear. This is the cloud-based GPU instance on-premises you’ve been waiting for. Find out more in NVIDIA and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure NVIDIA GPU Cloud Platform.
Partnership with Rescale
We’re also announcing a partnership with Rescale. They’re one of the leading HPC providers today. Availability of Rescale on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure makes it even easier for you to onboard and get your jobs running in under a day. Rescale has more than 450 applications already preinstalled on Oracle’s high-performance computing instances, making it easy and giving you the ability to bring your own licenses as well.
“Rescale takes the complexity out of high-performance computing in the cloud by providing an HPC platform that can be deployed in minutes,’ said Terry Danzer, COO at Rescale. “Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, with its industry first bare metal HPC shapes and low latency RDMA networking, offers the ideal platform for high-performance computing.”
Partnering with Ampere for Oracle’s First Arm Offering
Arm-based compute instances provide a great alternative for developers to diversify and take advantage of hardware innovation. To achieve this goal, we partnered with Ampere to bring an Arm offering to Oracle Cloud. These Arm-based instances provide developers with the best price-performance, compared to any other x86 Compute instance on a per core basis with an order of magnitude of cost savings.]
Early next year, we’re going to offer customers the ability to launch bare metal or virtual machine instances with up to 160 cores with 3.3 Ghz turbo frequency on wide variety of Linux distros, including Oracle Linux and Ubuntu. These instances are also part of our flexible Compute family, giving you the ability to pick and choose varying levels of cores or memory based on your workload characteristics and requirements.
Apart from pure Compute instances, you can also use these instances as part of our Always Free Tier, allowing you develop and test. Look out for more information on this offering later in the year.
Next Generation of Flexible, Elastic Computing
We recently announced our E3 instances, which were the first generation of our flexible infrastructure. Using the infrastructure, customers can design their instances with a custom number of CPU cores and memory to suit their workload and application needs, as opposed to getting set into fixed sizes with wasted resources and costs. Built on AMD’s Rome generation of CPUs, this service allows you to design custom shapes. For example, if you wanted two cores but 12-GB RAM, it’s now possible to design that custom, exact shape to match to the workload. As the least expensive per core Compute offering that we had in our portfolio of instances, it’s a great choice for general-purpose workloads.
To get even further toward our goal of truly responsive, performant, and cost-effective Compute services, early next year we’re going to offer customers E4 instances that build upon this platform with AMD’s next generation of CPUs instances. They allow for greater performance at the same economics, making this service ideal for general-purpose workloads or custom applications.
Get Started Today!
If you haven’t already, I recommend watching Clay’s keynote, along with special appearance from Intel CEO Bob Swan, NVIDIA Founder and CEO Jensen Huang, CEO of Ampere Renee James and AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su.
You also get to hear from customers and partners about how Oracle Cloud Infrastructure helped them transform, partner, and provide the best infrastructure available today.
You can get started today with some of our latest offerings by signing up for our Oracle Cloud Free Tier and get access to preview of future offerings by getting in touch with us directly.

Oracle Helps Customer Service Teams Embrace Change
Chris McGugan | September 17, 2020 | 3 minute read
Over the past few years, customer service organizations have undergone significant changes to meet evolving customer expectations, and the events of this year have understandably accelerated many of those trends.
If 2020 has taught us anything, it’s the importance of being resilient in the face of constant change. The pandemic turned customer service departments on their heads, shutting down at a moment’s notice and reopening with remote workers. At the same time, many service departments had been overrun with requests and have had to rethink how they operate in order to answer customers when and where customers want.
As service professionals look to the future—and in many cases, consider reinvention of their entire service departments—Oracle is here to help. To guide customers through these shifts and prepare them for the future, we have introduced a series of updates to Oracle Service within Oracle Advertising and Customer Experience.
New Digital Customer Service Tools
Context and understanding are everything in today’s environment. To help customer service teams meet these demands, we have introduced a series of new digital customer service tools.
Automated Service “Digital Trifecta”: Helps customer service teams deliver accurate service at scale by automating service 24/7 through the integration of our knowledge management, Intelligent Advisor, and Digital Assistant products.
Intelligent Advisor: An enhanced advisor helps enhance the customer experience with visuals such as uploading an ID, seeing a house on a map, and more, while also helping agents come to decisions faster with new real-time insights.
“Service at the Point of Need” Inlays: New inlays or “pop-ups” monitor digital behaviors to read signals when someone might need service, and then offer service proactively. Inlays are context-sensitive to ensure personalized and intelligent interactions.
New Service Center from Home Capabilities: As service departments stay remote during the pandemic—and look to maintain increased work-from-home programs afterward—we've introduced a series of new remote work tools.
Agent Experience Upgrades: To help service teams operate from anywhere and maintain productivity at scale, we've improved the agent experience in the Oracle Service browser user interface. This allows agents to provide service from home or any location, via any browser or device, through an intuitive and customizable system.
New Slack integration: A new Slack integration with Oracle Service gives agents a familiar tool to collaborate and resolve customer cases faster. Teams can drag and drop cases and stay better connected with teams while remote.
New Field Service Capabilities
Field service is vital in maintaining essential infrastructure (power, water, internet, etc.), as well as life-saving equipment (MRI machines, ventilators, etc.). To help organizations enhance field service capabilities, we've introduced new collaboration, digital assistant, and advisor capabilities.   
New “Where’s My Technician?” feature: Helps customers follow the progress of their service appointments and engage directly with the field service teams in a style similar to an Uber app experience. Customers can also confirm and change appointments, watch a vehicle pull up on a map, and more.
New Field Service Digital Assistant: A new digital assistant helps customer service teams save time by answering questions for technicians in the field.
New Customer Data Management Enhancements: Customer service data is a critical source of customer information that's often inaccurate and difficult to share with the rest of the organization. New features in B2C Service Customer Data Management validate and de-duplicate customer data to ensure accuracy and completeness, while making it easier to share customer data across the organization.
New Knowledge Management Capabilities: To help agents navigate massive knowledge databases and quickly discover the best content, we're introducing artificial intelligence (AI) advancements. New artificial intelligence capabilities proactively show agents the best answers, as well as help them write and search for informative articles.

New Gartner Reports On OCI IaaS + PaaS
Have you put Oracle on your short list of cloud infrastructure partners?
If not, there’s two new Gartner reports we think are worth reading: “It’s Time to Include Oracle as a Viable Option When Evaluating Public Cloud Providers” and the 2020 Gartner Solution Scorecard for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure IaaS+PaaS.
We believe that Oracle Cloud Infrastructure now meets the key requirements to run all enterprise-class, production-grade cloud workloads.
What We've Done
“Oracle is the provider whose scores improved the most in 2020” in the Solution Scorecard1 To us, this demonstrates strong engineering and innovation momentum. We’ve invested millions of developer hours over the last year to meet the needs of our customers, and I’m proud of the team’s accomplishments.
While Oracle Cloud Infrastructure remains a “primary strategic cloud provider” for all Oracle technologies, customers with other Enterprise applications, including SAP, Microsoft, IBM, custom applications, and other workloads with similar characteristics, should consider Oracle Cloud. Customers with high-performance use cases like Analytics, Cloud Native applications, and high-performance computing, would also benefit from Oracle’s “very good overall performance” and strong bare metal capabilities. You see that we can handle a broad range from real examples like 7-Eleven, who runs a portfolio of enterprise applications, and Zoom, who runs their cloud-native, real-time conferencing.
What We’re Doing Well
High-performance cloud infrastructure, including bare metal and virtual machine computing and GPUs, block storage, Exadata database, networking, and WAN connectivity through Oracle’s managed backbone network. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s architecture is designed for high network and I/O (input/output) performance with maximum I/O consistency. Consistent high performance matters every day, whether you’re closing the financial books at month end, digitally designing a new car, or simulating the weather.
Cloud region growth, Oracle now offers a broad and consistent set of cloud services across 26 regions in 12 countries on six continents to serve our global customer base. I’m especially excited to see our success in Japan, Brazil, and the Middle East. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s new San Jose, California cloud region continues an unprecedented rate of expansion, with 18 regions delivered in the last 12 months.
Private cloud that works just like our public cloud. We listened to our customers, many of whom have critical systems of record, and heard that we needed to build something complete, performant, and with full customer control. That’s why the Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer offers our full range of IaaS and PaaS services, keeps the control plane and data with the customer to ensure compliance, removes the pain of infrastructure management, and enables customers to run both their existing critical applications and modernization projects side by side.
Our modern data platform, including our Autonomous Database, its underlying high-performance platform, as well as our unique abilities to provide clustering and high availability for Oracle Databases, side-by-side with other data processing engines like Apache Spark.
Our customers want the highest assurances around security, data durability, and access to strong data services. According to the Solution Scorecard, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has an overall solution score of 62 out of 100, meets 74% of the required criteria, 48% of the preferred criteria, and 17% of optional criteria.

The Key Role of Warehouse Management in Building Resilient Supply Chains for Business Growth
Guest Author | August 11, 2020 | 3 minute read
By Diego Pantoja-Navajas, VP of WMS Cloud Development
The COVID-19 crisis has put the spotlight on supply chains like never before, and the average shopper now realizes that the lack of their favorite product at the local drugstore is a result of breakdowns across an intricate global network. 
What many people probably don’t know, though, is that one of the key links in the supply chain is the warehouse, as it’s the nerve center for controlling inventory and ensuring that organizations are able to make their deliveries on time.
Resilient supply chains lead to business growth – especially right now, as challenging times require resilience and create opportunity. And with warehouse management continuing to play an increasingly key role in supply chain resilience, we are pleased that Gartner has recognized us as a Leader in its 2020 Magic Quadrant for Warehouse Management Systems1 report. 
This is the fifth consecutive year we have been named a Leader in Warehouse Management Systems (WMS), and of 15 companies evaluated, we were placed based on our completeness of vision and ability to execute for Oracle Warehouse Management – part of Oracle Fusion Cloud Supply Chain & Manufacturing (Oracle Cloud SCM). A complimentary copy of the report is available here.

In the report, Gartner noted, “The WMS market remains vibrant with vendors continuing to innovate. Progress is being made in adaptability and support for automation while cloud services grow faster than the overall market.”
Oracle Warehouse Management is one of the industry’s expert cloud-based inventory and warehouse management systems, combining the speed and savings of the cloud with best-of-breed warehouse management and fulfillment capabilities. It’s easily configurable for a rapid, cost-effective implementation, helping customers support complex fulfillment operations, improve inventory and shipment accuracy, and gain total inventory visibility – from the distribution center to the store shelf.
Oracle Cloud SCM connects supply networks with an integrated suite of cloud business applications designed and built to outpace change. And Oracle continues to receive SCM industry recognition – it was recently named a Leader in Gartner’s 2020 “Magic Quadrant for Transportation Management Systems2.”
While shoppers at the local drugstore will never know it, cloud-based technologies will continue to be the key to building resilient supply chains that not only keep store shelves stocked, but enable businesses to make quick pivots to support sustained growth.

Oracle Helps Marketers Navigate Changes and Make Every Customer Interaction Matter
Shashi Seth | August 6, 2020 | 4 minute read
Senior Vice President, Oracle CX Marketing
Let’s be honest. 2020 has been a rollercoaster for anyone working in marketing and while you’d be forgiven for hoping to turn over the calendar to 2021, the reality is we are only just over half way through.
Many of us started the year in an economy that was booming and with a focus on huge customer acquisition targets. That playbook was quickly turned on its head as a very different reality shifted our focus to renewal, retention, and growth.
Change is obviously nothing new in marketing, but the speed and scale of the changes over the last few months are more significant that anything I have seen in my career. The reason I say that is it feels like someone has hit fast forward and we have gone through years’ worth of change in a matter of weeks. Things we knew before have quickly gone from nice to haves to must haves. The weakest links in every system have been exposed. And there’s more guessing what the cost of the status quo is.
To help you navigate all this change and seize this opportunity to rethink the role of marketing in your organizations, we have introduced a series of updates to Oracle Marketing within Oracle CX to help you learn more about your customers and make every interaction matter.  
1) New account-based marketing (ABM) capabilities
With budgets under the microscope, this is a time for focus and that’s why we have introduced a series of updates to enhance ABM strategies. A new account engagement dashboard for Oracle Eloqua Marketing Automation provides visibility into the activity on your most engaged accounts, while account enrichment with firmographic data from Oracle DataFox Data Management enables you to build highly targeted segments within Eloqua. In addition, by integrating Oracle Unity Customer Data Platform segments into Eloqua campaigns and campaign performance back into CX Unity profiles, we are further improving segmentation and targeting.
2) New Zoom, Webex, and Microsoft team integrations
We are all using video conferencing and collaboration tools more. These new integrations with Oracle Eloqua will help you reach your customers on these platforms with minimal effort.
3) New content management capabilities
To help improve the efficiency of content marketing programs, we have introduced pre-configured and reusable content blocks. With content blocks, you can create reusable, pre-styled and pre-configured blocks of content to use in landing pages and emails that will accelerate control and creation within Oracle Eloqua. Oracle Eloqua’s close integration with Oracle Content Management makes sharing content across teams a breeze while remote too.
4) New personalization capabilities
Context has risen to the top of the agenda and new intelligence capabilities for Oracle Responsys Campaign Management will help you simplify marketing production while optimizing for customers. For example, our new fatigue analysis will help you identify when you may be sending too many messages to an individual. A new intelligent switch can optimize the channel, time, and message to send to a customer. And an intelligent audience selector can help you find more customers who will respond well to your marketing automations. 
5) New loyalty and engagement capabilities
To drive more personalized interactions with members of loyalty programs, we have introduced a new polling capability within Oracle CrowdTwist Loyalty and Engagement. Polls are great for engagement and for collecting first-party data to enable more personalized interactions. It’s also another good way to gain additional insights beneficial to both the member and you.
6) New customer data platform enhancements
The latest enhancements to Oracle Unity Customer Data Platform will help you address the need for authentic, context-aware and empathetic communications by making it easy to create customer (B2C) and account (B2B) profiles. In addition, we have introduced a new B2B data model for targeting of accounts versus individual customers and added retail and automotive industry schemas that enable marketers in those industries to build and maintain customer profiles that are specific to the nuances of their industry.
We realize that there is not a silver bullet right now and that the rules are being constantly re-written, but we also know that this can be a huge opportunity to take fate into your own hands and choose the future for your career, brand, and industry. Whatever choice you make, we are here to support you every step of the way with the latest innovations, best practices, and marketing insights.
                                                                                                       Learn more about how we are helping customers make every customer interaction matter.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Behind World's Fastest Supercomputer
Mari Brands | August 5, 2020 | 2 minute read
Principal Technical Program Manager
RIKEN, the owner of the world’s fastest high-performance computing (HPC) supercomputer, Fugaku, has chosen Oracle Cloud as the public cloud provider for its elastic HPC storage and to enable universities and research organizations to connect securely and at low cost through Science Information Network (SINET). Oracle was chosen because of its superior performance, enterprise-grade security, and elastic storage resources as part of the ongoing initiative to promote wider use of the supercomputer.
Fugaku’s Performance
Performing at 415 quadrillion computations a second, or 415 petaFLOPS, Fugaku placed first in the Top500 in June 2020. The Top500 ranks supercomputers based on their processing speed and performance of computing power. Aptly named after Mt. Fuji, Fugaku’s world record-breaking high performance distanced itself far ahead of competitors by achieving approximately 2.8 times more calculations per second than the runner up.
Fugaku was deployed this year at RIKEN Center for Computational Sciences (R-CCS) in Kobe, Japan. Government-sponsored RIKEN and Fujitsu Limited jointly developed Fugaku with the goal of helping advance society by resolving complex social issues and scientific tasks that often require massive simulations and calculations.
R-CCS and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
This partnership between R-CCS and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure enables Fugaku users to use the Fugaku network connected securely with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure environment through SINET at its ultra-high speed.
Also, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s FastConnect, a dedicated, private network connection service, allows inbound and outbound bandwidth charges at no extra cost, while using its enterprise-grade reliability and scalability. Research projects where data may extend well into petabytes can use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s high-performance computing and storage resources without having to worry about the massive data transfer cost and run the workloads with predictable low costs. 
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is the only IaaS cloud provider to guarantee performance and manageability with service level agreements.
To further expand Fugaku’s adoption into various industries, RIKEN has launched a joint project with collaborative research partners, including Altair Engineering, HPC Systems, Co., Ltd, and Foundation for Computational Science. This project aims to drive Fugaku’s cloud-based usage services that use the computational resources of Fugaku with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Oracle Japan is working closely with RIKEN and its collaborative research partners in Fugaku’s domestic and oversea adoption expansion efforts.
